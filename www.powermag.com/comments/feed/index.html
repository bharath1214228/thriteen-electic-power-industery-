					<description><![CDATA[Wind farms do not really lower real estate value because that lower taxable value of the land and the county would not want to loose the tax base. True or false. What happens is the desire to buy the home is reduced. What I am saying is there are less buyers that want to live by them and raise thre family.I know this for a fact, Iive in a very nice spot called Elk Hieghts in the state of Washinton a very pristine view,farm land area and I see two wind farms from my house. One is 40 miles away the other is less than 5 miles away and the closes one to me I see out three sides of my home. It is true that there own impact report says there can be some issue,But the powers that be in the wind farm just tell you to kiss off. My home has no value because no one will buy it so, My 20 year investment is 100% worthless. You see it is not about people it&#039;s about money. Has the world gone crazy, Only a select few. As for the wind farm,Tear it down or pay me! You did not build it for the people,You built it for money.]]></description>
