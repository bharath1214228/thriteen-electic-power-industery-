<p>The Duquesne Light Co. (DLC) may not be among the best-known electric power companies in the U.S., but for its customers in Allegheny and Beaver counties in southwestern Pennsylvania, the company has been a steady presence in the community for more than a century.</p>
<p>“We are a Pittsburgh-based utility company. We’ve been in operation for over 140 years, serving the Pittsburgh area,” Kevin Walker, CEO of <a href="https://www.duquesnelight.com/company/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DLC</a>, said as a guest on <em>The POWER Podcast</em>. “We are very entwined with our community, doing a lot of community service and corporate giving. And since we’re a small but mighty utility, we know, live, and work with all of our customers. I see many customers in the supermarket and in the barber shop and those kinds of places. And so, I love to feel that we are really making an impact for the people we know and serve.”</p>
<p>Pittsburgh was the site of the Global Clean Energy Action Forum (GCEAF) in late September. Delegates from around the world gathered at the event hosted by the U.S. Department of Energy and Carnegie Mellon University. It was the first time the GCEAF was held in the U.S.</p>
<p>The three-day event featured high-level plenary sessions and topical roundtables with energy and science ministers, CEOs, and other experts and leaders (Figure 1). There were also various side events, technology demonstrations, and other activities throughout the week. Walker was a member of the host committee.</p>
<figure id="attachment_179467" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179467" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-179467" src="https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/gceaf-kevin-walker-roundtable.jpeg" alt="" width="720" height="540" srcset="https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/gceaf-kevin-walker-roundtable.jpeg 2400w, https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/gceaf-kevin-walker-roundtable-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/gceaf-kevin-walker-roundtable-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/gceaf-kevin-walker-roundtable-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/gceaf-kevin-walker-roundtable-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/gceaf-kevin-walker-roundtable-2048x1536.jpeg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-179467" class="wp-caption-text"><em>1. Duquesne Light Holdings President and CEO Kevin Walker speaks during a roundtable discussion at the Global Clean Energy Action Forum in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on Sept. 22, 2022. Courtesy: DLC</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>“We’re still riding the high off of that event. It was so exciting to have people from across the globe, here in Pittsburgh, really, to showcase the evolution and continuing evolution of Pittsburgh,” Walker said. “It was a great knowledge share both ways. We learned things from around the globe, as well as sharing our wisdom with folks around the globe.”</p>
<p>Walker said innovation and creativity are in Pittsburgh’s DNA, as is a willingness to collaborate. “I think that’s our secret sauce here as a region—we really collaborate well and there’s a low-to-no barrier to the folks helping each other,” he said. Walker felt the collaborative spirit extended to attendees from across the globe during the event and has continued even after the conference ended.</p>
<p>DLC has collaborated with other power companies, too. In late July, for example, the company announced that Commonwealth Edison (ComEd), an Exelon Corporation unit, and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. (PG&amp;E) had joined the first phase of DLC’s public crowdsourcing innovation challenge, called “Monitoring Electrical Cable Challenge: The Future of Underground Inspection.” The challenge was devoted to creating a more reliable and safer underground electric network in the Pittsburgh region.</p>
<p>With a total prize of $750,000, the challenge was shared with entrepreneurs, researchers, scientists, students, and more, and it drew submissions from around the world. ComEd and PG&amp;E are collaborating with DLC in two areas: guiding the challenge finalists on solution testing and evaluating the phase-one results. The winning solution is expected to strengthen the underground electrical grid and improve worker and public safety in DLC’s service territory, with the potential for further implementation in ComEd’s and PG&amp;E’s networks.</p>
<p>Yet, if you look at DLC’s website, the first thing listed under its “About Us” heading is “Community,” and Walker seems well-focused on that aspect. “We just really have this giving spirit and we want to be an important partner for our community,” he said. Part of that includes charitable giving, while addressing social and economic inequities, workforce development, and sustainable communities also play a role.</p>
<p>DLC has also made efforts to improve supplier diversity and work with more local suppliers. “Oftentimes, we have national and even international diverse suppliers. That is good, but it doesn’t put money back into our community. So, we’re happy and proud with the advancements we’ve made there,” Walker said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><em>Cast-iron motors meet or exceed NEMA Premium® efficiency standards for oil-and-gas/petrochemical, pulp-and-paper, grain and rock processing, other harsh environments</em></h3>
<p>Siemens announced the immediate availability of the SIMOTICS SD200 severe-duty motor in frame size 440 as its latest offering in the low-voltage SIMOTICS motor family.</p>
<p>Providing high productivity and energy-efficient operation in all torque ranges, these new cast-iron NEMA motors are built to power pumps, fans, compressors, hoists, winders and similar equipment in harsh environments. With a three-year warranty, the SD200 motors offer 75-800 hp output and feature 444-5013 cast-iron frames for operation in 460V and 575V ranges. They meet or exceed NEMA Premium® MG1 Table 12-12 efficiencies. A wide selection of options is offered, including IP56 ingress protection, encoders, brakes, and blowers plus others to suit the applications presented.</p>
<p>On these motors, the frame, end-shields, fan guard and easy-access, diagonally split, oversized terminal box are all cast-iron. Complementing this construction are zinc-plated hardware, epoxy paint and stainless-steel nameplates for long life and easy identification in the field. A unique offset rotor bar provides improved efficiency, while larger bars and end rings reduce resistance. Each die-cast aluminum rotor assembly is dynamically balanced for extended bearing life and includes a high-strength C1045 carbon steel shaft for maximum performance. Premium C5-grade steel laminations and copper magnet wire are standard.</p>
<p>For insulation, the Class-H non-hygroscopic system with NEMA Class B temperature rise provides an extra margin of thermal life. The insulation system meets or exceeds NEMA MG1 2014 Part 31, making these motors suitable for variable speed drives in constant torque (4:1) and variable torque (20:1). All windings are tested for Corona Inception Voltage (CIV).</p>
<p>The Siemens Product Manager for Low-Voltage NEMA Motors, Oscar Palafox, explains, “One of the features of the SD200 is its flexibility in the field, as the motor can be switched from F1 to F2 and F3 orientation with ease. Plus, the safety features on this new line are unmatched by competition. Full H-Class conformity provides winding protection, while the swivel hooks are a significant improvement over eyehooks for handling of these heavy units. In addition, the unique Siemens composite insulation on the SD200 is a cost-saver over the ceramic bearing alternative with ten times the resistance of other solutions in the market. Finally, the NEMA Premium® efficiency is a guarantee of long performance life with very tight deviation of losses. Shaft current remains more consistent for better uptime.” Palafox further notes this new line affords users Division II, Class 1 (gas) and Class 2 (dust) protection.</p>
<p>Siemens SIMOTICS SD200 frame size 440 low-voltage, severe-duty AC motors will be introduced at EASA 2021. They are designed for use in the harsh environments of oil-and-gas/petrochemical, grain, rock product, plus food-and-beverage and other markets with Division II, Class 1 and 2 conditions present.</p>

<p>GA’s FPP concept utilizes a steady-state, compact advanced tokamak design approach, where the fusion plasma is maintained for long periods of time to maximize efficiency, reduce maintenance costs, and increase the lifetime of the facility. <strong>To learn more about the concept, please visit: </strong><strong><a href="https://www.ga.com/fusion-pilot-plant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.ga.com/fusion-pilot-plant</a>. </strong></p>
<p>“Excitement for fusion energy is at an all-time high, with historic interest from private industry and government,”<strong> said Dr. Anantha Krishnan, Senior Vice President of the General Atomics Energy Group. </strong>“We look forward to working with our partners to make our vision for economic fusion energy a reality. Now is the time for fusion, and General Atomics plans to lead the way.”</p>
<p>Fusion is the process that powers the stars and offers the potential for nearly limitless clean energy. It occurs when two light nuclei combine to form a new one, releasing vast amounts of energy. Researchers can achieve fusion using a &#8220;tokamak,&#8221; which uses heat and electromagnets to create the necessary heat and pressure to force the nuclei to fuse.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_179310" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179310" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-179310 size-large" src="https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/general-atomics-fusion-pilot-1024x576.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/general-atomics-fusion-pilot-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/general-atomics-fusion-pilot-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/general-atomics-fusion-pilot-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/general-atomics-fusion-pilot.jpeg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-179310" class="wp-caption-text"><em>A render of the General Atomics Fusion Pilot Plant (interior).

<p>Fueled primarily by isotopes of hydrogen found in seawater and capable of generating its own fuel during operation, the GA FPP would provide baseload energy without any harmful emissions or long-lived waste. Capable of operating around the clock, commercialized fusion power plants would provide sustainable, carbon-free firm energy for generations.</p>
<p>“The General Atomics Fusion Pilot Plant is a revolutionary step forward for commercializing fusion energy,” <strong>said Dr. Wayne Solomon, Vice President of Magnetic Fusion Energy at General Atomics.</strong> “Our practical approach to a FPP is the culmination of more than six decades of investments in fusion research and development, the experience we have gained from operating the DIII-D National Fusion Facility on behalf of the U.S. Department of Energy, and the hard work of countless dedicated individuals. This is a truly exciting step towards realizing fusion energy.”</p>
<p>“General Atomics has a long and storied history of being at the forefront of fusion innovations,” <strong>said Dr. Brian Grierson, Director of the Fusion Pilot Plant Hub at General Atomics.</strong> “We are proud to be a world leader in plasma theory and modeling, advanced materials engineering, and other areas necessary for commercializing fusion. We intend to bring the full strength of our institutional expertise to this effort as we advance our vision for fusion energy.”</p>
<p>The GA FPP concept capitalizes on GA innovations and advancements in fusion technology. The facility would utilize GA’s proprietary Fusion Synthesis Engine (FUSE) to enable engineers, physicists, and operators to rapidly perform a broad range of studies and continuously optimize the power plant for maximum efficiency. GA has also developed an advanced modular concept (GAMBL) for the breeding blanket which is a critical component (of the fusion power facility) that breeds tritium, a fusion energy fuel source, to make the fusion fuel cycle self-sufficient.</p>
<p>General Atomics recently announced a <a href="https://www.ga.com/ga-and-savannah-river-national-lab-team-up-on-fusion-pilot-plant" target="_blank" rel="noopener">joint research partnership with Savannah River National Laboratory</a> to address challenges of tritium handling as part of the U.S. Department of Energy’s Innovation Network for Fusion Energy (INFUSE) grant program.</p>
<p>With extensive experience in at-scale manufacturing and established relationships across industry and government, GA is actively engaging with leading institutions around the world to pursue the most rapid, economically practical path to fusion energy—including universities, national laboratories, government, and industry. GA is working with a wide range of energy stakeholders to ensure that fusion is deployed in a way that meets the needs of local and global communities.</p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s3">The companies, in a joint statement <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221019005429/en">on Oct. 19</a>, said they intend to collaborate on a joint study to evaluate and potentially advance the potential project. The project could entail “the end-to-end energy value chain, utilizing each participant’s technical expertise in production, operational experience, storage, distribution, and export logistics,” the companies said. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">While the companies did not specify a size for the project, each of the consortium’s partners has been separately developing capabilities and expertise in air separation technology, hydrogen technologies, lower carbon intensity and renewable natural gas, carbon capture and storage (CCS), electrolysis-based technologies, and petrochemicals.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">The companies said that the project could “leverage existing advantages along the Gulf Coast, including pipeline infrastructure, to supply lower carbon and renewable hydrogen to local industrial clusters.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Likewise, “ammonia infrastructure could support exports to both Europe and the Asia Pacific region,” they said.</span></p>
<h2>A Skilled Consortium</h2>
<p class="p6"><span class="s4">Air Liquide, a world leader in industrial gas supply, including oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen, in January 2021, inaugurated one of the world’s largest proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers in </span><span class="s5">Bécancour, Québec. The 20-MW PEM electrolyzer, equipped with Cummins technology, sources wind and hydropower from </span><span class="s6">Hydro-Québec for the hydrogen market in the northeast. The PEM project supplied a </span><span class="s3">recently completed <a href="https://www.powermag.com/nypa-ge-successfully-pilot-hydrogen-retrofit-at-aeroderivative-gas-turbine/"><span class="s7">GE aeroderivative gas turbine </span></a>project to demonstrate hydrogen combustion as part of a retrofit at an existing U.S. natural gas power plant, which successfully utilized blends of 5% to 44% hydrogen with natural gas</span><span class="s6">. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s8">“</span><span class="s3">The Gulf Coast is the ideal location to model hydrogen and carbon capture technologies as immediate pathways to decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors. This project exemplifies Air Liquide’s commitment to decarbonizing industrial basins around the world,” said Adam Peters, CEO of Air Liquide North America. “Prioritizing sustainable technologies, like hydrogen and carbon capture, means we can provide energy transition careers for many thousands of American workers while building a more sustainable energy future for all.” </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s3">Uniper, Germany’s giant utility that holds a 33 GW generation fleet, is working to decarbonize its business in Europe by 2035, including its 2,200 TWh natural gas procurement portfolio. While the German government recently took over the company, the company has been working on several hydrogen initiatives, including <a href="https://www.powermag.com/windgas-falkenhagen-pioneering-green-gas-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">power-to-gas</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s3">“Uniper is very excited to collaborate with this unique group of companies to explore a truly transformative U.S. Gulf Coast hydrogen infrastructure project,” Marc Merrill, President and CEO of Uniper in North America, said in a statement. “We look forward to bringing the best of our U.S. business and global technical and commercial platforms to support this effort. Uniper is committed to the green expansion of our Wilhelmshaven [liquefied natural gas] receiving terminal in Germany and expects to receive and store roughly 1 [million tonnes per annum (Mpta)] of clean ammonia at the port by the end of the decade. U.S. Gulf Coast supply from this initiative can be critical to meeting that goal.”</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">Chevron, an integrated energy company that produces crude oil and natural gas; manufactures transportation fuels, lubricants, petrochemicals, and additives, is actively investing in scalable low-carbon solutions under its <a href="https://www.chevron.com/operations/new-energies">Chevron New Energies</a> business segment. The company already produces </span><span class="s9">about 1 million tonnes per year of hydrogen through its traditional business and has experience in retail hydrogen going back to 2005. The company is also actively deploying CCS, including at  <a href="https://www.chevron.com/projects/gorgon"><span class="s10">Gorgon</span></a>, Australia, one of the world’s largest integrated CCS projects. “</span><span class="s3">Across the value chain, collaborations are critical to developing a hydrogen ecosystem, and this is an example of bringing together leaders in the space to explore lower carbon hydrogen opportunities and to contribute complementary expertise,” said Austin Knight, vice president of Hydrogen at Chevron New Energies. </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s3">LyondellBasell has also recently stepped up its circularity and climate ambitions and actions to address the global challenges of plastic waste and decarbonization. “While our products play an important role in helping to enable greenhouse gas emissions reductions through their use in renewable energy technologies, such as wind turbines, solar panels and electric batteries, we are also taking concrete steps to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from our operations,” said Aaron Ledet, senior vice president of Olefins and Polyolefins Americas at LyondellBasell.</span></p>
<h2>Major Projects Developing on the Gulf Coast</h2>
<p class="p12"><span class="s2">The consortium’s announced plans follow several significant announcements in recent months by major energy and chemical companies for the Gulf Coast. In September, OCI N.V., an Amsterdam, Netherlands–headquartered producer and distributor of hydrogen-based products that provides low-carbon fertilizers, fuels, and feedstock to agricultural, transportation, and industrial customers, said it would leverage the </span><span class="s11">Inflation Reduction Act (IRA’s) 45Q measures to kick off construction of a 1.1 Mtpa blue ammonia facility that will feature infrastructure to enable potentially doubling its capacity to 2.2 Mtpa.</span></p>
<p class="p14"><span class="s3">“Blue ammonia is produced from hydrogen derived from natural gas where the CO</span><sub><span class="s12">2</span></sub><span class="s3"> by-product is captured and sequestered. Green ammonia is produced from hydrogen based on renewable sources such as wind and solar rather than fossil fuels,” the company explained. OCI noted that its two core products, ammonia and methanol, “are the most promising hydrogen carriers to drive the hydrogen economy and enable the energy transition.” </span></p>
<p class="p14"><span class="s3">OCI’s project has been designed to transition from blue to green ammonia production in the future as green hydrogen becomes available at larger scale,” the company said.” OCI has reported the project is well underway. Detailed engineering and procurement work started earlier this year, and production is targeted for Q1 2025, the <a href="https://www.oci.nl/news/2022-oci-to-start-construction-of-new-world-scale-hydrogen-based-blue-ammonia-facility-in-texas-with-production-expected-in-q1-2025/"><span class="s13">company said</span></a>. The “optimal location” in Beaumont, Texas, near Houston, has “easy access to both the US and export markets including Europe and Asia to serve significant expected demand for clean hydrogen,” it said. </span></p>
<p class="p15"><span class="s4">In another notable project announced in September, Uniper and Japanese power giant JERA said they will collaborate with<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></span><span class="s14">ConocoPhillips to pursue fuel supply projects for clean ammonia and LNG to meet </span><span class="s15">domestic demand and JERA’s and Uniper’s European fuel supply needs across the short-, medium- and long-term. The companies are developing green and blue ammonia export projects. One project envisions initial production of 2 Mtpa with expansion potential from the Gulf Coast, including both green and blue clean ammonia production when CCS facilities are available.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">A project engineering study is slated to be completed by year-end to develop the first phase of the project, which will assess green and blue hydrogen opportunities. JERA and Uniper expect the project will reach commercial operation in the late 2020s, including a complete certified CCS program.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="s3">“Both companies are working jointly to optimize their LNG portfolio. As a result, Uniper will be able to supply additional LNG to Germany and JERA to Japan and beyond,” the <a href="https://www.uniper.energy/news/jera-and-uniper-announce-collaboration-on-clean-ammonia-and-lng-from-the-united-states"><span class="s16">companies said</span></a>. </span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="s3">“The combination of a skilled workforce, plentiful natural gas, abundant renewable resources, deep-water ports, and ideal CCS geology make the U.S. Gulf Coast uniquely advantaged to produce the low carbon fuel to enable the Atlantic and Pacific energy markets transition,” noted Steven Winn, CEO of JERA Americas, which is based in Houston. “JERA and ConocoPhillips will be a low-cost ammonia supplier to domestic and international markets. We believe this project offers a unique opportunity to support Germany’s decarbonization efforts while advancing ammonia technology development for hydrogen distribution and industrial decarbonization.”</span></p>

<p>U.S. utilities need to be proactive in adapting to the changing environment. To minimize the impact of worsening peak loads and a variable energy mix, they need to make strategic decisions and measures to manage future risks posed by key levers.</p>
<p>While the IRA offers incentives for renewable energy sources, clean hydrogen, carbon capture and sequestration, electric vehicles (EVs), heat pumps for homes, and more, transmission infrastructure was much smaller (about $3 billion) and may need expansion with future outlays, whereas funding for cybersecurity, a major concern for utilities, was non-existent (Figure 1).</p>

<p>Although the IRA addresses climate change, the electrification trend it accelerates will likely exacerbate issues already facing utilities.</p>
<p><strong>Worsening Duck Curve.</strong> Prior to the IRA, peak demand was forecasted to increase 20% to 30% by 2030 for regions of the U.S. with high EV penetration rates. The IRA incentives for purchasing an EV will likely intensify this “duck curve” phenomenon, leading to an increased peak demand of 30% to 40% by 2030. Greater heat pump penetration is also predicted, but unlike EVs the effect from these appliances will not be as concentrated during peak load times.</p>
<p><strong>More Variable Generation Mix.</strong> By 2030, variable renewable sources, wind and solar, will make up approximately 25% to 30% of grid power compared to today’s 13%. By contrast, the two largest sources of firming power, natural gas and coal, will decline to 40% to 48% from today’s roughly 60%.</p>
<p>Coal’s decline is much discussed, but natural gas is also set to decline in relative share (30% to 32% from 35%). This is largely driven by the reduction in demand over the past 15 years, whereas demand for renewable sources has steadily increased. With renewables becoming more economical, downward pressure is put on natural gas infrastructure investment. Many U.S. cities are already phasing out natural gas in new construction to “green” their grids, eroding baseload capacity and making grids more dependent on variable sources of energy supply.</p>
<p><strong>Tying It All Together.</strong> Grid power variability becomes clearer when combined with the duck curve effect. As peak loads spike, grids have less baseload capacity to rely on and risk not meeting demand during daily peaks (Figure 2).</p>

<h2>Flipping the Right Switch</h2>
<p>Utilities must decide which levers are the most effective in addressing the concerns of these emerging market dynamics, from worsening peak loads to more variable energy mix.</p>
<h3>Lever 1: Generation and Storage Technologies to Deliver Clean Stable Power Throughout the Day</h3>
<p>The IRA’s technology-agnostic incentives have broad implications for levelized cost of electricity for established technologies and emerging solutions (Figure 3). This can change how utility’s view generation and storage levers at their disposal while being aware of the need to de-risk many first-of-a-kind technologies.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_179287" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179287" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-179287" src="https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/fig3-partners-in-performance.jpg" alt="Partners-in-Performance" width="720" height="480" srcset="https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/fig3-partners-in-performance.jpg 720w, https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/fig3-partners-in-performance-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-179287" class="wp-caption-text"><em>3. Levelized cost of electricity pre- and post-IRA. Courtesy: Partners in Performance</em></figcaption></figure></p>
<p><strong>Wind and Solar Commoditization. </strong>Solar and wind are the most economical sources of generation in many regions and are likely to keep decreasing their cost curves due to the IRA extending existing tax credits and adding “bonuses” for domestic material use and locating sites in low-income and fossil-fuel dependent/impacted communities.</p>
<p><strong>Storage Increasingly Viable as Pairing with Variable Renewables.</strong> Existing lithium-ion technology paired with wind and solar becomes cost-effective in helping mitigate the intermittency of these energy sources—even if battery technology is not ideal for grid-scale use. Iron-phosphate (LFP) and flow batteries become more attractive alternatives as they mature technologically. More so, early-stage development zinc-based batteries from Canada-based e-Zinc have expanded storage duration to 50 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Geothermal Showing Promise as Firming Power Alternative.</strong> Conventional geothermal stands to benefit from cost reductions. The coming advances in geothermal, with companies like Eavor developing closed-loop systems and Sage Geosystems testing enhanced geothermal systems with the hope to widen applicability into regions thought to be ill-suited for the technology, could broaden technological adoption to provide clean baseload power and support grid reliability.</p>
<p><strong>Hydrogen Blends and Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) with Combined Cycle Gas Turbines (CCGTs) Will Need to Advance Quickly to be Impactful.</strong> While natural gas still has a key role in providing firming power, this will likely change with battery and geothermal technology becoming more viable and cost competitive. CCUS and hydrogen blending paired with CCGT—although theoretically promising with the new IRA incentives—needs to advance in technological readiness to be considered a utility-scale option.</p>
<h3>Lever 2: Transmission &amp; Distribution (T&amp;D) to Shift Electricity Demand and Prevent Outages</h3>
<p>Utilities have other downstream levers to mitigate the effects of increased electrical demand and potential grid instability from renewable intermittency.</p>
<p>Addressing discharge to grid, an emerging EV model uses time-of-use (TOU) rates and demand response (DR) programs to shift electricity usage to off-peak times. For TOU rates, utilities offer options with enough price difference between off-peak and peak times to encourage EV owners to shift charging to lower-cost periods. DR programs, a comparatively mature lever, have become more accessible to customers, with utilities incentivizing the installation of DR-enabling technologies and embracing third-party programs to manage thermostats, water heaters, and EVs in response to TOU rates.</p>
<p>With the rise of distributed energy resources (DERs), opportunities are emerging for virtual power plants (VPPs) to support better demand response by the grid. One example is Google-backed OhmConnect’s platform, providing customers incentives and benefits to organize electricity usage to avoid high-risk times by integrating appliances and devices from 30 companies and manufacturers.</p>
<p>Once a critical mass of DERs is reached, community microgrids can increase resiliency by disconnecting (“islanding”) and reconnecting to the overall grid. Critical infrastructure like hospitals and government facilities have successfully established microgrids to reduce energy spend and ensure continuity during extreme weather events. Utilities can be proactive by helping shape which customers adopt what technology in a particular service area.</p>
<p>Major investment in “traditional” T&amp;D infrastructure is still needed. The American Society for Civil Engineers reports funding gaps of $95 billion for distribution alone by 2025 (more than two times the gap seen in transmission). Hardening infrastructure is another option to ensure grid resiliency as extreme weather events become commonplace. To illustrate, Florida’s three major utilities—Florida Power &amp; Light, Duke Energy Florida, and Tampa Electric Co.—recently filed proposals for a combined $566 million in undergrounding, hardening of electrical systems, and vegetation management in response to more intense hurricanes.</p>
<h3>Lever 3: Cybersecurity to Help Prevent Breaches and Outages</h3>
<p>Cybersecurity concerns affect the entire utility value chain and are likely to increase in importance as grid infrastructure expands, the variety of assets on the grid increases, and as the two-way flow of information between utility and customer increases.</p>
<p>Cybersecurity is already a critical issue for utilities as data breach costs reach a high of $9.44 million with ransomware attacks increasing by 50% in two years. Recent attacks on the Colonial Pipeline and a Florida water treatment plant are two examples. Utilities must put cybersecurity at the center of designing, building, and operating their infrastructure.</p>
<h3>Lever 4: Regulatory Refinement to Support Grid Flexibility and Infrastructure Development</h3>
<p>As both the ownership model and role of utilities evolves, the regulatory environment must align with them. Utilities need to consider how to engage the stakeholder ecosystem to shape policy and meet customer needs for safe, reliable, affordable, and equitable power.</p>
<p><strong>Ownership.</strong> Many utilities are adopting a “shared responsibility model” in EV charging infrastructure, with utilities providing capital for “make-readies” and the interconnection review process, while private charging companies own and operate charging stations. Utilities benefit from this partnership by protecting their system reliability and using the providers’ data to optimize charging. Pepco, Eversource Energy, Georgia Power, and Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&amp;E) use this model, with PG&amp;E having a dedicated EV team who significantly improved interactions with its third-party electricity provider, EVgo.</p>
<p><strong>Role of Utility.</strong> The traditional role of utilities is shifting from building and maintaining infrastructure to orchestrating energy resources for optimized safety and affordability by utilizing cleaner and more affordable resources. For utilities to succeed in this new role, they need to leverage existing regulation, where possible, while learning from other markets on how to best shape policy in their own territories. One example is redefining how pilots are deployed. Connecticut’s Public Utilities Regulatory Authority (PURA) built an “innovation pilots” framework for scaling pilots or ending them—potentially limiting spend on projects not providing a return/benefit to rate payers.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The IRA offers new incentives for renewable energy development and electrification, while bringing fresh challenges for utilities and exacerbating existing ones. It could leave utilities with the bill for potentially worsening duck curves and more variable energy mix.</p>
<p>To ensure their future success, utilities must apply the right levers to address emerging market dynamics and their changing roles (Figure 4). The price of inaction means massive disadvantages by falling behind in energy transition and delivering inferior services, which could result in serious reputational damage with customers flocking to alternatives. Those who do act and leverage the right solutions will solidify their primacy as leaders in a rapidly changing market.</p>

These issues, in addition to geopolitical tensions, are deeply complex and cannot be addressed on an individual scale.</p>
<p>In addition, the energy industry faces major challenges pertaining to communication given that the workforce and equipment operate in remote and harsh environments. With assets and personnel continuously on the move in areas that lack traditional methods of connectivity, it can be difficult to monitor productivity and access field data. This, in turn, can impact other critical events or environmental compliance standards, as well as emergency response safeguards.</p>
<p>While individual businesses cannot strengthen the global supply chain independently, solve the labor shortage, or reconcile international relations, fortunately, the latter set of issues related to connectivity can be ameliorated. Where terrestrial cellular coverage falls short, satellite connectivity prevails. With satellite coverage, continuous connectivity can be ensured for remote asset tracking, asset management, secure communications at exploration sites, monitoring transmission and deliveries tracked by internet of things (IoT) infrastructure, and worker safety for improved business efficiencies.</p>
<p>Given the current strain on the energy industry, it’s imperative to save costs and increase productivity whenever possible. Certain challenges may be uncontrollable, but issues such as visibility, connectivity, and communication can undoubtedly be addressed and doing so will result in significant benefits for business owners, employees, and customers alike.</p>
<h2>Satellite IoT in Action</h2>
<p>Satellite IoT refers to the use of satellite communication networks and services to connect terrestrial IoT sensors and IoT end-nodes to a server. IoT enables interconnectivity between objects such that they can communicate and relay orders without requiring human-to-human or even human-to-computer interaction. The type of information relayed depends upon the specific IoT sensor, which is determined based on the use case.</p>
<p>As a concept, it can be challenging to grasp how revolutionary this technology can be for the energy sector. While continuous, dependable connectivity and asset management sound useful, how exactly is the value realized? There are an infinite number of ways that satellite IoT can be implemented; the limit of its applications is constrained only by the limit of the imagination.</p>
<p>Take cathodic protection (CP), for example. CP systems keep corrosion under control, thus protecting the millions of miles of metallic pipelines that carry petroleum products, natural gas, water, and wastewater throughout our communities. However, to continue to be effective, these systems must eventually be replaced. Traditionally, site inspections by pipeline personnel are required multiple times per year. With thousands of miles of pipelines running through remote territory, a significant amount of time must be devoted to staffing time and travel costs.</p>
<p>However, with satellite IoT, CP systems can be monitored wirelessly for pipeline operators around the world. The satellite IoT device provides continuous performance monitoring with automated alerts to unusual conditions or failure, and the ability to test remotely. Furthermore, technicians can use any web-enabled device to access a cloud platform to see where CP systems are operating normally and to download performance data, generate reports, and remotely modify device configurations.</p>
<p>Another prevalent application for satellite IoT in the energy industry is oil tank monitoring. To maintain oil production, the fluid levels in storage tanks at a drill site require regular monitoring. Legacy measurement systems are complicated, costly to install and calibrate, and often require personnel to check gauges by hand. Tank monitoring is increasingly being handled remotely, but for drilling rigs on the move, cellular connection is unreliable.</p>
<p>Satellite enabled IoT tools can illuminate data on tank levels including GPS coordinates, allowing drilling companies and their vendors to see all tanks, establish automatic alerts when levels are low, and automate dispatch of supply trucks to refill the tanks. Smart data processing on edge devices allows for limited data transmission when tanks require no action and the condensation of data into short messages, therefore reducing transmission costs. Drilling companies can effectively save thousands of unnecessary hours and ensure that fluids are always available to support uninterrupted operation.</p>
<p>These examples are just a sample of the litany of ways in which satellite IoT technology can be leveraged throughout the energy sector.</p>
<h2>Continuous Connectivity Meets Customization</h2>
<p>To truly grasp the dependability of satellite connectivity, it’s important to understand that this technology is relied upon to save thousands of lives each year. For personnel working in remote locations, satellite messengers can be used to share information on location and status in case of an emergency. If thousands are willing to utilize satellite communications when their lives are at stake, every business owner should have peace of mind when it comes to using the same technology to monitor and manage their equipment, fleets, or assets.</p>
<p>In addition to reliability, satellite IoT solutions can be customized to suit specific needs or use cases. Embedded satellite IoT chips can integrate with a wide range of hardware based on application needs. However, the true breadth of customization is realized on the software end of IoT.</p>
<p>With certain devices and enablement platforms, instead of custom-coding for specific device hardware, developers can, utilizing a low-code platform, hardware abstraction, and unified APIs, seamlessly interface between application and capabilities of the satellite IoT edge device. By developing artificial intelligence (AI)-driven applications that send smart data from the edge, energy businesses can effectively reduce the transmission fee associated with sending data from the IoT device to the endpoint, or server, and improve operational performance.</p>
<p>Flexibility is also a useful attribute of satellite IoT solutions. Say, for instance, an organization is looking to expand its IoT capabilities, additional sensors can deliver valuable new capabilities quickly and easily by using Bluetooth connectivity. Furthermore, if a business would benefit from machine learning and executable files to improve the performance of systems in the field, the right IoT partner will have the storage and processing power necessary to run applications at the edge, and the platform to simplify configuration, application development, and device management.</p>
<p>As society continues to advance along with technology, many are looking to renewable energy options in addition to traditional energy sources like oil and gas. These energy production methods are also often located in remote areas and would benefit from satellite IoT as much as any other organization that has people and assets located in isolated areas.</p>
<p>The beauty of satellite IoT is that it will work for you, regardless of your specific needs or geographical location. For those who operate in remote areas that stand to gain from improved visibility, reliability, reduced cost, and repurposed employee hours, consider satellite IoT to help meet the current demands of the energy sector.</p>

<p class="p1">GCube, an international insurer for wind, solar, wave, hydro, and tidal projects around the world in an update on Oct. 18 said the U.S. renewables market “just experienced its worst summer on record” for natural catastrophe claims. <span class="s1">Financial impacts from these weather-related events have been exacerbated by the sector’s ongoing vulnerability to supply chain challenges, “</span><span class="s2">with significant financial implications tied to increased downtime and component costs,” the group said. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“</span><span class="s2">While total claims values are still being calculated, multiple instances of losses exceeding sub-limits of up to $50 million, due to extreme weather events like hail, tornados, and derechos, make clear the need for improved modeling and the more effective use of existing weather data,” it warned.</span></p>
<h2>Unprecedented but Not Unexpected</h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The group’s concerns stem from a trend of “large-scale” damages suffered by the North American renewable energy sector in recent years, owing to some of the most destructive extreme weather events &#8220;in living memory.&#8221; It’s clear, GCube said, that natural catastrophes and extreme weather events “are on the rise.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“While the increasing frequency of extreme weather and [natural catastrophe] events is not surprising to us, the rising severity of losses, and the industry’s continued difficulty in managing these risks, is a concerning trend,” said Fraser McLachlan, GCube’s CEO. “The unprecedented growth potential unlocked by the Inflation Reduction Act will count for little if the North American renewables sector is unable to combat extreme weather risks.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">In its Tuesday-released <i><a href="https://www.gcube-insurance.com/reports/north-american-nat-cat-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">North American Nat Cat Update</a>, </i>GCube, a member of the Tokio Marine HCC group, noted that insured property losses due to natural disasters have been on the rise across all industries, surging to $92 billion in 2021 from $74 billion in 2020. Recent losses in the renewables sector suggest that unmodeled events continue to outpace modeled natural catastrophe events in terms of frequency. Over the last three years, the insurance industry has recorded 40 severe storms—encompassing high winds, hail, tornadoes, and derechos—compared to 13 traditional windstorm events, such as hurricanes, it said.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">A surge in hail and rainstorm losses has grown into a specific concern owing to its pronounced impact on the solar industry. GCube&#8217;s report suggests, for example, that hail losses <a href="https://www.weather.gov/lub/events-2022-20220531-storms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Texas early this summer</a> resulted in estimated solar damage of more than $300 million—more than twice as severe as other key renewable losses over the last three years combined. “</span><span class="s3">Multiple solar losses are reported to have </span><span class="s4">exceeded sub-limits of up to $50 million </span><span class="s3">as a result of [natural catastrophe] events over the last two to three years, while tornado losses in some cases are reported to match the anticipated value of damages from Hurricane Hanna,” the report says.</span></p>

The <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/femp/severe-weather-resilience-solar-photovoltaic-system-design" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Federal Energy Management Program suggests</a> that most solar modules currently pass the IEC 61215 hail test standard. However, “field experience has demonstrated that hail exceeding this standard can occur frequently in areas where the [Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)] indicates at least a ‘relatively high’ risk of a hail event.” Source: U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)</em></figcaption></figure></p>
<h2>Solar&#8217;s Notable Vulnerabilities</h2>
<p class="p6">Solar appears to be especially vulnerable to losses because of the sector’s increased exposure to natural catastrophe risks. GCube&#8217;s report suggests that <span class="s5">“</span>developments of solar technology are behind the curve when it comes to improving weather resistance.&#8221; A key issue stems from testing whose minimum requirements are easy to pass. “The International Electrotechnical Commission’s (IEC&#8217;s) hail tests utilize projectiles of 25 [milimeters], which are half the size of the average hailstone experienced in the ‘very severe’ hailstorms we are seeing more frequently across the continent,” the report says. “Meanwhile, there remains no requirement to test for micro-cracking, a key issue which causes considerable issues for insurers,” it adds.</p>
<p class="p6">That is in “sharp contrast” to wind turbine testing, which targets scale, strength, and weather-proofing against severe events like typhoons, it said. The solar industry, meanwhile, has been moving toward adopting thinner panes of glass to reduce raw materials required for construction, but that is a trend that could hamper panel resilience to weather events. Clearly, original equipment manufacturers &#8220;need to consider their accountability for developing solar technologies that can withstand severe weather trends,” it adds. “Solar has some catching up to do.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">GCube’s McLachlan said a more adequate market correction will be needed to address the growing severity of natural catastrophes and extreme weather events, given that a softening of rates could jeopardize the sustainable growth of U.S. wind and solar. GCube urges project owners to work with insurers to revise sub-limits regularly, using the latest understanding of risks, to ensure that assets will be appropriately covered in the event of a claim. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Concerted effort is needed across the value chain to strengthen policies, improve data utilization, and update modeling and testing procedures, and support sustainable growth for the sector,” McLachlan said. “Our latest report issues a clear call for collaboration in the U.S. renewables industry to develop measures to combat the fallout of extreme weather, and support a stable, successful energy transition.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States and Canada are in a leadership position with carbon capture, utilization, and storage projects. The industry is developing rapidly due net zero goals and 45Q tax incentives, but companies face challenges with project staffing, equipment constraints, and regulatory permitting. Carbon capture and sequestration must reach gigaton scale in order to achieve net zero goals.</p>
<p><span class="legendSpanClass">HOUSTON</span>, <span class="legendSpanClass">Oct. 17, 2022</span> /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ &#8212; ALJ Group created the <a href="https://uscarboncaptureforum.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Carbon Capture Forum</a> after a successful event series for hydrogen and LNG. The carbon capture forum brought together industry experts on policy, funding, technology, and project execution.</p>
<p>Princeton University&#8217;s Net Zero America report expects carbon sequestration in the United States to increase to 1.5 gigatons by 2050 in a low electrification scenario and reach about 1 gigatons by 2050 in a high electrification scenario.</p>
<p>Todd Bush, the chairman of the event, opened the conference by stating, &#8220;In order to reach our net zero goals, we must get to gigaton scale for carbon capture. That is one billion metric tons of carbon sequestered per year. The United States and Canada have had the most success with carbon capture and storage with more demonstrations, more pilots, and more operational facilities to draw on lessons learned.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Decarbonfuse data, there are <a href="https://decarbonfuse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">75 projects in North America under development</a> including direct air capture, carbon sequestration, and blue hydrogen projects. Many of these projects expect to be operational in 2024 to 2026 presenting potential supply chain constraints for the industry.</p>
<p>Key points during the American Carbon Capture Forum were regulatory permitting, supply chain, and staffing challenges that face the industry.</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Primacy CO2 wells. North Dakota and Wyoming are the only states with primacy, so additional states competent with regulating injection wells will likely seek approval from the EPA to regulate CO2 sequestration wells at a state level. Likely states include Texas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Colorado, Oklahoma, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia.</li>
<li>Equipment constraints. Ramp up in projects will create constraints for compressors, absorbers, blowers, and other capture equipment. Industry leading EPCs such as Worley, McDermot, KBR, and Air Liquide commented that proper planning and collaboration with suppliers and vendors will be critical for delivering projects on time and on budget.</li>
<li>Project staffing. Increased project activity will also highlight staff and crew constraints according to top carbon capture engineering firms Kiewit, Black &amp; Veatch, and Flour. Each company described plans and techniques to overcome project staffing challenges to handle incoming project requests.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;ALJ Group is aware that it won&#8217;t be possible to get to net zero without advancing carbon capture, utilization and storage technologies and Texas has the potential to become a very important hub for that,&#8221; said Larry Keras, CEO of ALJ Group, organizers of the American Carbon Capture Forum.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://uscarboncaptureforum.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Carbon Capture Forum</a> is an annual event covering North America policy, projects, technology, and funding needed to grow the industry.</p>

<p>The company’s investments in its electric delivery system over the past decade have prevented 1.1 million weather-related customer outages. Those upgrades have included placing overhead lines underground, installing stronger poles and wires and deploying smart switches on lines to minimize service interruptions when a tree or branch falls on the wire.</p>
<p>Con Edison’s climate change experts consult with peers in private industry and academia to stay abreast of the latest climate science. Con Edison is using those findings to plan investments that will make its energy systems more resilient and reliable.</p>
<p>The company has also improved its response to weather events to get customers back in service faster and its communications with customers before and during emergencies.</p>
<p>“Our climate change studies are driving the strategic infrastructure investments needed to protect customers and prevent outages,” said Tim Cawley, the chairman and chief executive of Con Edison. “Our customers, and the region as a whole, are experiencing increasingly more frequent and severe weather events. We must continue to address climate change by planning, building and operating a more resilient grid.”</p>
<h2><strong>Climate Change Expertise</strong></h2>
<p>The region’s future will bring more heat waves, severe floods, heavier snow and stronger winds. The changing climate threatens the company’s electric, gas and steam systems, according to a <a href="https://cdne-dcxprod-sitecore.azureedge.net/-/media/files/coned/documents/our-energy-future/our-energy-projects/climate-change-resiliency-plan/climate-change-vulnerability-study.pdf?rev=5b8c1152e5424477a480b1a6d91fa7d2&amp;hash=24C8291EDE99AD0A61592A36249E45B7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a> the company’s experts developed with ICF and Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.</p>
<p>Con Edison followed up with a <a href="https://www.coned.com/-/media/files/coned/documents/our-energy-future/our-energy-projects/climate-change-resiliency-plan/climate-change-resilience-adaptation-2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> detailing how the company will integrate climate considerations into power supply forecasting, planning, engineering, operations, and emergency response practices.</p>
<p>&#8220;The work by Con Edison to anticipate and prepare for extreme events caused or worsened by climate change advances the global state of the art,&#8221; said Michael Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School. “Recent hurricanes that have knocked out the power systems in Florida, Puerto Rico, and other places, and extreme heat that nearly caused blackouts in California, highlight the importance of these efforts.”</p>
<p>The company now builds new facilities that are expected to be in operation for 80 years to withstand flooding from a 100-year storm plus an additional three feet of sea level rise.</p>
<h2><strong>Building Reliability and Resilience</strong></h2>
<p>In the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy, Con Edison developed a number of system resiliency plans and invested $1 billion in strengthening its energy systems. Then, following two destructive storms in March 2018, the company initiated a $100 million program to further fortify its systems in Westchester County.</p>
<p>To address the impact of flooding events, Con Edison has hardened its delivery system by raising equipment, building walls, and installing pumps. Crews have also installed submersible transformers and other equipment that can withstand a deluge of salty water and stay in service.</p>
<p>Con Edison also reconfigured two electrical networks in Lower Manhattan to better withstand severe flooding events. New switching technology in those networks allows company operators to selectively turn off service to flood impacted areas near the coast while allowing inland customers to stay in service.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_179065" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179065" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-179065" src="https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/fig1-superstorm-sandy-10-year-anniversary-con-edison.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="474" srcset="https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/fig1-superstorm-sandy-10-year-anniversary-con-edison.jpg 720w, https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/fig1-superstorm-sandy-10-year-anniversary-con-edison-300x198.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-179065" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Con Edison workers restoring service to customers following Superstorm Sandy.</em></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>The company last year placed certain overhead lines in the Middle Village area of Queens and in northern Westchester underground. That protects the equipment from storms that can knock branches and trees onto lines.</p>
<p>Con Edison has a proposal pending with the state to make additional storm fortification improvements, including placing more overhead lines underground.</p>
<h2><strong>Improved Storm Response</strong></h2>
<p>A fleet of new utility trucks allows mutual aid workers to arrive by plane and get right to the task of restoring service to Con Edison customers after a storm.</p>
<p>Con Edison marshalled a massive response to Sandy, bringing in more than 5,000 external workers, some from as far away as California, to restore service.</p>
<p>But the trucks, which are in Pomona, about 40 miles north of New York City, speed restoration because the company can fly workers to the area, rather than wait for them to arrive in their own vehicles.</p>
<p>The company took delivery of 90 trucks this year. The trucks, leased property and other expenses represent an investment of about $34 million.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_179067" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179067" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-179067" src="https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/fig2-superstorm-sandy-10-year-anniversary-con-edison.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="449" srcset="https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/fig2-superstorm-sandy-10-year-anniversary-con-edison.jpg 720w, https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/fig2-superstorm-sandy-10-year-anniversary-con-edison-300x187.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-179067" class="wp-caption-text"><em>New Con Edison bucket trucks in a lot in Pomona. The trucks allow workers from outside the area to fly into the region and have quick access to vehicles, so that they can begin the work of restoring service to customers.</em></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>The company also has improved on its storm response by negotiating contracts that guarantee access to outside workers when the company needs them. Since the March 2018 storms, the company has increased its mutual aid resource contracts by seven times and gotten access to more than 1,000 workers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.coned.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Con Edison</a> is a subsidiary of Consolidated Edison, Inc. [NYSE: ED], one of the nation’s largest investor-owned energy companies, with approximately $14 billion in annual revenues and $64 billion in assets.

<p>Ontario Power Generation (OPG) and Czech Republic-based ČEZ are collaborating to advance deployment of nuclear technology, including small modular reactors (SMRs). The companies said they signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on Oct. 11, with an aim to “reduce financial, technical and schedule risk to both parties on their respective future projects.”</p>
<p>OPG is Ontario’s largest electricity generator. The company has 75 generating stations in the province with a combined capacity of more than 18 GW. In addition to 66 hydroelectric facilities, its fleet includes two nuclear stations—the 3.5-GW Darlington facility and the 3.1-GW Pickering station (Figure 1). OPG says nuclear power provides about 60% of Ontario’s power today.</p>

<p>“Ontario Power Generation is a world-class nuclear operator, with decades of experience in providing safe, clean, reliable nuclear power,” OPG President and CEO Ken Hartwick said in a statement. “Working together with entities like ČEZ, we can leverage our combined experience to develop and build the new technology needed to power the future and meet decarbonization goals.”</p>
<p>ČEZ is one of Europe’s largest energy companies. Both OPG and ČEZ have committed to achieving net zero goals by 2040, and they believe advanced reactor technology can help in that mission.</p>
<h2>Darlington SMR</h2>
<p>Under the MOU, OPG and ČEZ will share information related to the deployment of new nuclear projects. OPG has said new nuclear generation, including SMRs, is “an essential part of the electricity mix needed to decarbonize the energy sector and broader economy.” OPG is in the process of deploying an SMR at its Darlington site and has already received approval of an Environmental Assessment.</p>
<p>In December 2021, OPG said it would work with GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy on the Darlington SMR project. GE Hitachi’s BWRX-300 (Figure 2) is a 300-MWe water-cooled, natural circulation SMR with passive safety systems. It is the 10th evolution of GE’s boiling water reactor (BWR). The company says the BWRX-300 represents the simplest and most innovative BWR design since it began developing nuclear reactors in 1955.</p>

<p>On March 10 this year, OPG announced it had awarded a $32 million contract to E.S. Fox Limited for the first phase of site preparation and support infrastructure for the Darlington SMR project. Among the infrastructure work expected to be completed under the contract is bringing water, electrical power, information technology, and roads to the site. The Darlington SMR is expected to be operational by the end of this decade.</p>
<h2>ČEZ’s Nuclear Fleet</h2>
<p>ČEZ is no stranger to nuclear power either. It currently operates two nuclear power plants (NPPs) in the Czech Republic. The four-unit Dukovany site (Figure 3) was the first NPP built on Czech territory, and, according to the company, it is “one of the largest, most reliable, and economically advantageous energy sources” in ČEZ’s fleet. Dukovany is located 30 kilometers (km) southeast of Třebíč. It produces about 20% of the total electricity consumption in the Czech Republic.</p>

The Dukovany Nuclear Power Plant, with an installed capacity of 2,040 MW, is the second-largest nuclear power plant in the Czech Republic. Courtesy: ČEZ</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Dukovany plant has four VVER 440 model V 213 pressurized water reactors (PWRs). The individual units were put into operation between 1985 and 1987. The original total installed electrical capacity was 1,760 MW, but output has been gradually increased through turbine upgrades, efficiency programs, and technical improvements. Today, the power plant has an installed capacity of 2,040 MW.</p>
<p>ČEZ also operates the dual-unit Temelin NPP, which is situated about 24 km from the South Bohemian capital České Budějovice. Temelin has two VVER 1000 Type V 320 PWRs. The units entered operation in 2000 and 2003, respectively. The station generates roughly the same electricity annually as the Dukovany plant.</p>
<h2>A Partnership with Potential</h2>
<p>Like OPG, ČEZ has taken first steps toward expanding its nuclear fleet at both Temelin and Dukovany. “As a company, we are focused on developing new energy solutions and technologies,” Tomáš Pleskac, member of the Board of Directors and chief of the New Energy Division with ČEZ, said in a statement. “We are preparing for the construction of a new nuclear unit in Dukovany and the upcoming allocation of space at Temelín, where the first SMR could be built in the first half of the next decade. The collaboration with OPG is therefore, for us, a logical step forward.”</p>
<p>“Ontario is proud to lead the way on clean nuclear technologies,” Ontario’s Energy Minister Todd Smith, said in a statement. “With our robust nuclear supply chain and talented workforce, we are ready to support the global deployment of our nuclear expertise that will help reduce emissions while delivering energy security to the world.”</p>
