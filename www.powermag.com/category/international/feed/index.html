										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><em>Cast-iron motors meet or exceed NEMA Premium® efficiency standards for oil-and-gas/petrochemical, pulp-and-paper, grain and rock processing, other harsh environments</em></h3>
<p>Siemens announced the immediate availability of the SIMOTICS SD200 severe-duty motor in frame size 440 as its latest offering in the low-voltage SIMOTICS motor family.</p>
<p>Providing high productivity and energy-efficient operation in all torque ranges, these new cast-iron NEMA motors are built to power pumps, fans, compressors, hoists, winders and similar equipment in harsh environments. With a three-year warranty, the SD200 motors offer 75-800 hp output and feature 444-5013 cast-iron frames for operation in 460V and 575V ranges. They meet or exceed NEMA Premium® MG1 Table 12-12 efficiencies. A wide selection of options is offered, including IP56 ingress protection, encoders, brakes, and blowers plus others to suit the applications presented.</p>
<p>On these motors, the frame, end-shields, fan guard and easy-access, diagonally split, oversized terminal box are all cast-iron. Complementing this construction are zinc-plated hardware, epoxy paint and stainless-steel nameplates for long life and easy identification in the field. A unique offset rotor bar provides improved efficiency, while larger bars and end rings reduce resistance. Each die-cast aluminum rotor assembly is dynamically balanced for extended bearing life and includes a high-strength C1045 carbon steel shaft for maximum performance. Premium C5-grade steel laminations and copper magnet wire are standard.</p>
<p>For insulation, the Class-H non-hygroscopic system with NEMA Class B temperature rise provides an extra margin of thermal life. The insulation system meets or exceeds NEMA MG1 2014 Part 31, making these motors suitable for variable speed drives in constant torque (4:1) and variable torque (20:1). All windings are tested for Corona Inception Voltage (CIV).</p>
<p>The Siemens Product Manager for Low-Voltage NEMA Motors, Oscar Palafox, explains, “One of the features of the SD200 is its flexibility in the field, as the motor can be switched from F1 to F2 and F3 orientation with ease. Plus, the safety features on this new line are unmatched by competition. Full H-Class conformity provides winding protection, while the swivel hooks are a significant improvement over eyehooks for handling of these heavy units. In addition, the unique Siemens composite insulation on the SD200 is a cost-saver over the ceramic bearing alternative with ten times the resistance of other solutions in the market. Finally, the NEMA Premium® efficiency is a guarantee of long performance life with very tight deviation of losses. Shaft current remains more consistent for better uptime.” Palafox further notes this new line affords users Division II, Class 1 (gas) and Class 2 (dust) protection.</p>
<p>Siemens SIMOTICS SD200 frame size 440 low-voltage, severe-duty AC motors will be introduced at EASA 2021. They are designed for use in the harsh environments of oil-and-gas/petrochemical, grain, rock product, plus food-and-beverage and other markets with Division II, Class 1 and 2 conditions present.</p>

<p><strong>San Diego, Oct. 20, 2022</strong> – Today, General Atomics (GA) announced a new concept for a fusion pilot plant (FPP) to deliver clean, safe, and economically viable fusion energy.</p>
<p>GA’s FPP concept utilizes a steady-state, compact advanced tokamak design approach, where the fusion plasma is maintained for long periods of time to maximize efficiency, reduce maintenance costs, and increase the lifetime of the facility. <strong>To learn more about the concept, please visit: </strong><strong><a href="https://www.ga.com/fusion-pilot-plant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.ga.com/fusion-pilot-plant</a>. </strong></p>
<p>“Excitement for fusion energy is at an all-time high, with historic interest from private industry and government,”<strong> said Dr. Anantha Krishnan, Senior Vice President of the General Atomics Energy Group. </strong>“We look forward to working with our partners to make our vision for economic fusion energy a reality. Now is the time for fusion, and General Atomics plans to lead the way.”</p>
<p>Fusion is the process that powers the stars and offers the potential for nearly limitless clean energy. It occurs when two light nuclei combine to form a new one, releasing vast amounts of energy. Researchers can achieve fusion using a &#8220;tokamak,&#8221; which uses heat and electromagnets to create the necessary heat and pressure to force the nuclei to fuse.</p>
<figure id="attachment_179310" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179310" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-179310 size-large" src="https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/general-atomics-fusion-pilot-1024x576.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/general-atomics-fusion-pilot-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/general-atomics-fusion-pilot-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/general-atomics-fusion-pilot-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/general-atomics-fusion-pilot.jpeg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-179310" class="wp-caption-text"><em>A render of the General Atomics Fusion Pilot Plant (interior).

<p>Fueled primarily by isotopes of hydrogen found in seawater and capable of generating its own fuel during operation, the GA FPP would provide baseload energy without any harmful emissions or long-lived waste. Capable of operating around the clock, commercialized fusion power plants would provide sustainable, carbon-free firm energy for generations.</p>
<p>“The General Atomics Fusion Pilot Plant is a revolutionary step forward for commercializing fusion energy,” <strong>said Dr. Wayne Solomon, Vice President of Magnetic Fusion Energy at General Atomics.</strong> “Our practical approach to a FPP is the culmination of more than six decades of investments in fusion research and development, the experience we have gained from operating the DIII-D National Fusion Facility on behalf of the U.S. Department of Energy, and the hard work of countless dedicated individuals. This is a truly exciting step towards realizing fusion energy.”</p>
<p>“General Atomics has a long and storied history of being at the forefront of fusion innovations,” <strong>said Dr. Brian Grierson, Director of the Fusion Pilot Plant Hub at General Atomics.</strong> “We are proud to be a world leader in plasma theory and modeling, advanced materials engineering, and other areas necessary for commercializing fusion. We intend to bring the full strength of our institutional expertise to this effort as we advance our vision for fusion energy.”</p>
<p>The GA FPP concept capitalizes on GA innovations and advancements in fusion technology. The facility would utilize GA’s proprietary Fusion Synthesis Engine (FUSE) to enable engineers, physicists, and operators to rapidly perform a broad range of studies and continuously optimize the power plant for maximum efficiency. GA has also developed an advanced modular concept (GAMBL) for the breeding blanket which is a critical component (of the fusion power facility) that breeds tritium, a fusion energy fuel source, to make the fusion fuel cycle self-sufficient.</p>
<p>General Atomics recently announced a <a href="https://www.ga.com/ga-and-savannah-river-national-lab-team-up-on-fusion-pilot-plant" target="_blank" rel="noopener">joint research partnership with Savannah River National Laboratory</a> to address challenges of tritium handling as part of the U.S. Department of Energy’s Innovation Network for Fusion Energy (INFUSE) grant program.</p>
<p>With extensive experience in at-scale manufacturing and established relationships across industry and government, GA is actively engaging with leading institutions around the world to pursue the most rapid, economically practical path to fusion energy—including universities, national laboratories, government, and industry. GA is working with a wide range of energy stakeholders to ensure that fusion is deployed in a way that meets the needs of local and global communities.</p>
<p><strong><em>About General Atomics:</em></strong><em> Since the dawn of the atomic age, General Atomics innovations have advanced the state of the art across the full spectrum of science and technology – from nuclear energy and defense to medicine and high-performance computing. Behind a talented global team of scientists, engineers, and professionals, GA’s unique experience and capabilities continue to deliver safe, sustainable, economical, and innovative solutions to meet growing global demands.</em></p>

<p>U.S. utilities need to be proactive in adapting to the changing environment. To minimize the impact of worsening peak loads and a variable energy mix, they need to make strategic decisions and measures to manage future risks posed by key levers.</p>
<p>While the IRA offers incentives for renewable energy sources, clean hydrogen, carbon capture and sequestration, electric vehicles (EVs), heat pumps for homes, and more, transmission infrastructure was much smaller (about $3 billion) and may need expansion with future outlays, whereas funding for cybersecurity, a major concern for utilities, was non-existent (Figure 1).</p>
<figure id="attachment_179285" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179285" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-179285" src="https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/fig1-partners-in-performance.jpg" alt="Partners-in-Performance" width="720" height="480" srcset="https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/fig1-partners-in-performance.jpg 720w, https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/fig1-partners-in-performance-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-179285" class="wp-caption-text"><em>1. Key aspects of Inflation Reduction Act. Courtesy: Partners in Performance</em></figcaption></figure>
<h2>Utilities Are Left with the Bill</h2>
<p>Although the IRA addresses climate change, the electrification trend it accelerates will likely exacerbate issues already facing utilities.</p>
<p><strong>Worsening Duck Curve.</strong> Prior to the IRA, peak demand was forecasted to increase 20% to 30% by 2030 for regions of the U.S. with high EV penetration rates. The IRA incentives for purchasing an EV will likely intensify this “duck curve” phenomenon, leading to an increased peak demand of 30% to 40% by 2030. Greater heat pump penetration is also predicted, but unlike EVs the effect from these appliances will not be as concentrated during peak load times.</p>
<p><strong>More Variable Generation Mix.</strong> By 2030, variable renewable sources, wind and solar, will make up approximately 25% to 30% of grid power compared to today’s 13%. By contrast, the two largest sources of firming power, natural gas and coal, will decline to 40% to 48% from today’s roughly 60%.</p>
<p>Coal’s decline is much discussed, but natural gas is also set to decline in relative share (30% to 32% from 35%). This is largely driven by the reduction in demand over the past 15 years, whereas demand for renewable sources has steadily increased. With renewables becoming more economical, downward pressure is put on natural gas infrastructure investment. Many U.S. cities are already phasing out natural gas in new construction to “green” their grids, eroding baseload capacity and making grids more dependent on variable sources of energy supply.</p>
<p><strong>Tying It All Together.</strong> Grid power variability becomes clearer when combined with the duck curve effect. As peak loads spike, grids have less baseload capacity to rely on and risk not meeting demand during daily peaks (Figure 2).</p>

<h2>Flipping the Right Switch</h2>
<p>Utilities must decide which levers are the most effective in addressing the concerns of these emerging market dynamics, from worsening peak loads to more variable energy mix.</p>
<h3>Lever 1: Generation and Storage Technologies to Deliver Clean Stable Power Throughout the Day</h3>
<p>The IRA’s technology-agnostic incentives have broad implications for levelized cost of electricity for established technologies and emerging solutions (Figure 3). This can change how utility’s view generation and storage levers at their disposal while being aware of the need to de-risk many first-of-a-kind technologies.</p>
<figure id="attachment_179287" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179287" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-179287" src="https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/fig3-partners-in-performance.jpg" alt="Partners-in-Performance" width="720" height="480" srcset="https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/fig3-partners-in-performance.jpg 720w, https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/fig3-partners-in-performance-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-179287" class="wp-caption-text"><em>3. Levelized cost of electricity pre- and post-IRA. Courtesy: Partners in Performance</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Wind and Solar Commoditization. </strong>Solar and wind are the most economical sources of generation in many regions and are likely to keep decreasing their cost curves due to the IRA extending existing tax credits and adding “bonuses” for domestic material use and locating sites in low-income and fossil-fuel dependent/impacted communities.</p>
<p><strong>Storage Increasingly Viable as Pairing with Variable Renewables.</strong> Existing lithium-ion technology paired with wind and solar becomes cost-effective in helping mitigate the intermittency of these energy sources—even if battery technology is not ideal for grid-scale use. Iron-phosphate (LFP) and flow batteries become more attractive alternatives as they mature technologically. More so, early-stage development zinc-based batteries from Canada-based e-Zinc have expanded storage duration to 50 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Geothermal Showing Promise as Firming Power Alternative.</strong> Conventional geothermal stands to benefit from cost reductions. The coming advances in geothermal, with companies like Eavor developing closed-loop systems and Sage Geosystems testing enhanced geothermal systems with the hope to widen applicability into regions thought to be ill-suited for the technology, could broaden technological adoption to provide clean baseload power and support grid reliability.</p>
<p><strong>Hydrogen Blends and Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) with Combined Cycle Gas Turbines (CCGTs) Will Need to Advance Quickly to be Impactful.</strong> While natural gas still has a key role in providing firming power, this will likely change with battery and geothermal technology becoming more viable and cost competitive. CCUS and hydrogen blending paired with CCGT—although theoretically promising with the new IRA incentives—needs to advance in technological readiness to be considered a utility-scale option.</p>
<h3>Lever 2: Transmission &amp; Distribution (T&amp;D) to Shift Electricity Demand and Prevent Outages</h3>
<p>Utilities have other downstream levers to mitigate the effects of increased electrical demand and potential grid instability from renewable intermittency.</p>
<p>Addressing discharge to grid, an emerging EV model uses time-of-use (TOU) rates and demand response (DR) programs to shift electricity usage to off-peak times. For TOU rates, utilities offer options with enough price difference between off-peak and peak times to encourage EV owners to shift charging to lower-cost periods. DR programs, a comparatively mature lever, have become more accessible to customers, with utilities incentivizing the installation of DR-enabling technologies and embracing third-party programs to manage thermostats, water heaters, and EVs in response to TOU rates.</p>
<p>With the rise of distributed energy resources (DERs), opportunities are emerging for virtual power plants (VPPs) to support better demand response by the grid. One example is Google-backed OhmConnect’s platform, providing customers incentives and benefits to organize electricity usage to avoid high-risk times by integrating appliances and devices from 30 companies and manufacturers.</p>
<p>Once a critical mass of DERs is reached, community microgrids can increase resiliency by disconnecting (“islanding”) and reconnecting to the overall grid. Critical infrastructure like hospitals and government facilities have successfully established microgrids to reduce energy spend and ensure continuity during extreme weather events. Utilities can be proactive by helping shape which customers adopt what technology in a particular service area.</p>
<p>Major investment in “traditional” T&amp;D infrastructure is still needed. The American Society for Civil Engineers reports funding gaps of $95 billion for distribution alone by 2025 (more than two times the gap seen in transmission). Hardening infrastructure is another option to ensure grid resiliency as extreme weather events become commonplace. To illustrate, Florida’s three major utilities—Florida Power &amp; Light, Duke Energy Florida, and Tampa Electric Co.—recently filed proposals for a combined $566 million in undergrounding, hardening of electrical systems, and vegetation management in response to more intense hurricanes.</p>
<h3>Lever 3: Cybersecurity to Help Prevent Breaches and Outages</h3>
<p>Cybersecurity concerns affect the entire utility value chain and are likely to increase in importance as grid infrastructure expands, the variety of assets on the grid increases, and as the two-way flow of information between utility and customer increases.</p>
<p>Cybersecurity is already a critical issue for utilities as data breach costs reach a high of $9.44 million with ransomware attacks increasing by 50% in two years. Recent attacks on the Colonial Pipeline and a Florida water treatment plant are two examples. Utilities must put cybersecurity at the center of designing, building, and operating their infrastructure.</p>
<h3>Lever 4: Regulatory Refinement to Support Grid Flexibility and Infrastructure Development</h3>
<p>As both the ownership model and role of utilities evolves, the regulatory environment must align with them. Utilities need to consider how to engage the stakeholder ecosystem to shape policy and meet customer needs for safe, reliable, affordable, and equitable power.</p>
<p><strong>Ownership.</strong> Many utilities are adopting a “shared responsibility model” in EV charging infrastructure, with utilities providing capital for “make-readies” and the interconnection review process, while private charging companies own and operate charging stations. Utilities benefit from this partnership by protecting their system reliability and using the providers’ data to optimize charging. Pepco, Eversource Energy, Georgia Power, and Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&amp;E) use this model, with PG&amp;E having a dedicated EV team who significantly improved interactions with its third-party electricity provider, EVgo.</p>
<p><strong>Role of Utility.</strong> The traditional role of utilities is shifting from building and maintaining infrastructure to orchestrating energy resources for optimized safety and affordability by utilizing cleaner and more affordable resources. For utilities to succeed in this new role, they need to leverage existing regulation, where possible, while learning from other markets on how to best shape policy in their own territories. One example is redefining how pilots are deployed. Connecticut’s Public Utilities Regulatory Authority (PURA) built an “innovation pilots” framework for scaling pilots or ending them—potentially limiting spend on projects not providing a return/benefit to rate payers.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The IRA offers new incentives for renewable energy development and electrification, while bringing fresh challenges for utilities and exacerbating existing ones. It could leave utilities with the bill for potentially worsening duck curves and more variable energy mix.</p>
<p>To ensure their future success, utilities must apply the right levers to address emerging market dynamics and their changing roles (Figure 4). The price of inaction means massive disadvantages by falling behind in energy transition and delivering inferior services, which could result in serious reputational damage with customers flocking to alternatives. Those who do act and leverage the right solutions will solidify their primacy as leaders in a rapidly changing market.</p>

Global companies have been transitioning from traditional fossil fuels to specialty fossil fuels, such as industrial heating oil (IHO) and CO<sub>2</sub>-as-Energy. In addition to cost savings (25% to 30%), they offer relatively high heat output. Due to this, companies across industries, especially in Europe, actively seek specialty fossil fuel alternatives. Therefore, to build resiliency, it is imperative for procurement heads to leverage the supply market featuring more than 700 companies by tapping different categories of suppliers.</em></strong></p>
<p>Amid the rising supply chain issues (Europe’s ban on Russian gas), energy crisis, and expanding costs, companies are increasingly moving away from traditional fossil fuels to actively scout for alternates. They are on the lookout for best-suited alternatives from the perspectives of application use case, supply economics, and pricing fit. In lieu of this, it is imperative to understand the current market situation for natural gas and its impact on price as the rationale for the transition to alternate fuels.</p>
<h2>Ongoing Gas Crisis</h2>
<p>The ongoing global energy crisis is one of the worst circular energy shortages experienced over the last five decades. The crisis has emerged across the oil, gas, and electricity markets, particularly impacting Europe and China, among others.</p>
<p>The Russia-Ukraine war has been fueling the gas crisis, with the European sanctions against Russia leading to a crucial supply deficit in the market. The struggle to secure global supplies is becoming more intense, as countries compete to secure scarce cargo of liquefied natural gas (LNG) ahead of winter in the Northern Hemisphere. In Europe, gas prices surged more than sevenfold since 2021, crossing $50/MMBtu in July 2022. With no relief in prices expected in the middle term, companies have been evaluating alternative fuels in the market.</p>
<h2>Alternative Fossil Fuels to the Rescue</h2>
<p>In the short-to-middle term, companies seek ways to de-risk their procurement process and enhance their dependency on specialty fossil fuels for production. Industrial heating oil (IHO) is one such key alternative.</p>
<p>IHO is another energy source that companies are interested in using in their boilers and other heating machinery. IHO is cost-effective over its counterparts of fossil fuels, considering the current prices for IHO are 25% to 30% lower than those for natural gas. Moreover, IHO provides higher heat output (138,690 Btus per gallon) compared with natural gas (1,030 Btus per cubic foot; 135 cubic feet equals heat content of 1 gallon of oil) at a lesser cost and can be stored and used for years.</p>
<p>From the sourcing standpoint, it is imperative to leverage the multiple sources/categories of suppliers, especially in European markets, such as the refineries wherein crude oil distillate and feedstock are refined and oil products are traded. Furthermore, the industries can also tap wholesalers/distributors (greater than 400 in Europe) and tank storage facility/terminal providers (100 to 150 in Europe).</p>
<h2>Undoubted CO<sub>2</sub> Potential</h2>
<p>While carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is more famous for its adverse environmental impact, it is a valuable commodity that can be put to good industrial usage to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and work toward sustainability/climate control while resolving issues faced by industries in terms of energy requirements. According to a report by the International Energy Agency (IEA), globally, about 230 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub> are used every year by industries, with fertilizer makers being the frontrunners, followed by oil and gas companies. Considering the growing potential of CO<sub>2</sub>, it is imperative to tap multiple sources/categories of suppliers, especially in Europe and Latin America, such as bio LNG plants, carbon capture and utilization (CCU), industrial CO<sub>2</sub> bulk cylinder suppliers, industrial CO<sub>2</sub> manufacturers, fertilizer manufacturers, as well as the distributors/importers of CO<sub>2</sub>. These existing suppliers can be leveraged for various needs such as CO<sub>2</sub>, liquid CO<sub>2</sub>, and bio/green CO<sub>2</sub>, while the dedicated carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects/programs can be considered for securing CO<sub>2</sub> supplies from a mid- to long-term perspective.</p>
<h2>Biofuels—The Long-Term Target</h2>
<p>Although CO<sub>2</sub> and IHO are increasingly considered alternatives by companies to reduce the impact of supply chain disruptions, trade tension, and environmental concerns on functioning, the sustainable solution to these concerns, and a robust and healthy tomorrow, lies in biofuels.</p>
<p>Currently, companies are sourcing biofuels such as bioethanol and biodiesel as clean/sustainable alternatives to traditional fossil fuels such as natural gas, diesel, and kerosene. The use of these biofuels not only leads to reduced maintenance of boilers/other heating equipment due to their clean nature but also exhibits effective long-term solutions characterizing sustainability/decarbonization advantage. The next-generation biofuels such as advanced bioethanol, biomethanol, green diesel, and hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) biodiesel are imminent to gain traction in days to come. We will soon see bioenergy stocks trading higher than fossil fuels on the bourses, and the economic well-being of a country being defined based on its bioenergy capacities over petrochemicals.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>It is imperative for global procurement leads/category managers to assess supply chain jeopardies, track volatility, and gauge price risks associated with the sourcing of traditional fossil fuels. It is highly critical to actively watch out for supply options available across specialty fossil fuels such as IHO and CO<sub>2</sub> to build a resilient supply chain. Therefore, the takeaways are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leverage the European IHO supply market characterizing the presence of greater than 500 companies by tapping various supplier categories such as refinery companies, wholesalers/distributors, and specialty tank storage facility providers.</li>
<li>Tap the CO<sub>2</sub> energy market across Europe and Latin America by exploring the supplier landscape of more than 200 companies and prioritizing different categories such as bio LNG plants, CCUs, bulk cylinder suppliers, industrial manufacturers, fertilizer manufacturers, and CO<sub>2</sub></li>

Countries have issued targets to reduce or even eliminate the use of traditional fossil fuels in order to reduce emission of greenhouse gases such as CO<sub>2</sub>. Gas turbine original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are responding by investing in hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) combustion. They are spending heavily on the development of combustors and other components that will enable gas turbines to operate with hydrogen blends. Some have issued roadmaps on how they will eventually operate their entire fleets with H<sub>2</sub>. This is seen as a key aspect of ongoing decarbonization efforts (Figure 1).</p>

As more plants blend hydrogen with natural gas, HRSGs will have to be upgraded to cope. Source: Archie Robb</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>“Natural gas generation with 30% hydrogen by volume delivers an 11% reduction in CO<sub>2</sub>,” said Richard Saab, a sales manager at Siemens Energy.</p>
<p>While hydrogen-fired gas turbines are big news, a lot less attention is being paid to the impact of hydrogen on other areas of the gas-powered generation supply chain such as heat recovery steam generators (HRSGs). Yet, a great deal of the global gas turbine fleet operates in combined cycle mode with the turbines connected to HRSGs. Those HRSGs will have to deal with factors such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hydrogen has a higher flame temperature than natural gas.</li>
<li>The water dewpoint of the flue gas increases when firing hydrogen.</li>
<li>Colder parts of the HRSG in contact with flue gas will suffer from high levels of condensation.</li>
<li>H<sub>2</sub> combustion requires a higher volume of exhaust gas flow than natural gas.</li>
<li>Hydrogen introduces additional safety concerns that must be dealt with.</li>
</ul>
<p>“Boiler makers have decades of experience in dealing with hydrogen,” said Kevin Slepicka, vice president of HRSGs at HRSG manufacturer Rentech Boiler Systems. “HRSGs present some additional challenges, but these are well within the capabilities of the vendor community.”</p>
<h2>HRSG Basics</h2>
<p>HRSGs are high-efficiency heat exchangers that are used to extract heat from an exhaust gas stream to convert water into steam for use in combined cycle generation, or to produce steam for use in industrial processes. They consist of a complex arrangement of pipes with water flowing through them. When water exchanges heat with the hot gas, it is converted into steam. The primary components within the HRSG are the superheater, the evaporator, and the economizer (Figure 2). Duct burners are usually installed before the superheaters, while selective catalytic reduction (SCR) units are often deployed to reduce NO<sub>x</sub> levels.</p>
<figure id="attachment_179278" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179278" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-179278" src="https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/fig2-hrsg-heat-recovery-steam-generator-drew-robb.png" alt="HRSG-heat-recovery-steam-generator" width="720" height="442" srcset="https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/fig2-hrsg-heat-recovery-steam-generator-drew-robb.png 720w, https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/fig2-hrsg-heat-recovery-steam-generator-drew-robb-300x184.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-179278" class="wp-caption-text"><em>2. The primary elements of the HRSG are the superheater, the evaporator, and the economizer. Courtesy: SoftInWay</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are major differences in temperature across the HRSG. The economizer temperature is much lower than the superheater section. Water fed into the economizer is preheated and passed to the evaporator to be converted into steam. As the name suggests, the superheater is used to superheat the steam to be fed to the steam turbine.</p>
<p>When hydrogen blends are introduced into HRSGs that were designed for natural gas combustion, certain factors must be appreciated. Hydrogen is a much lighter molecule than methane. It has a lower Btu value per unit of volume—natural gas has about five times the heating value per unit of volume, which means a far larger volume of hydrogen is needed for the combustion process. This impacts piping and metering stations that feed the turbine.</p>
<p>“Hydrogen has a high mass related heating value of 51,600 Btu/pound, as well as a density that is eight times lower than methane,” said Saab.</p>
<p>The higher flame temperature of hydrogen (roughly 4,000F versus 3,600F) means NO<sub>x</sub> becomes more of an issue. Burners, too, may need to be modified.</p>
<h2>HRSG Modifications</h2>
<p>Burner companies such as John Zink Hamworthy will usually determine the best size for fuel injectors used in hydrogen service. Minor modifications may be needed to HRSG duct burners depending on the amount of hydrogen being introduced. Separate hydrogen valve trains and firing elements will also need to be installed due to differences in heating value and supply pressure (Figure 3).</p>
<figure id="attachment_179279" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179279" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-179279" src="https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/fig3-combined-cycle-power-plant-drew-robb.jpg" alt="combined-cycle-power-plant" width="720" height="540" srcset="https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/fig3-combined-cycle-power-plant-drew-robb.jpg 720w, https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/fig3-combined-cycle-power-plant-drew-robb-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-179279" class="wp-caption-text"><em>3. This plant is fired by refinery gas where the hydrogen in the fuel can range from about 30% to 80%, but is typically about 50%. The HRSG is coupled to a 22-MW gas turbine.

<p>“The presence of hydrogen is likely to reduce performance; this must be compensated for with better burners and some design modifications,” said Slepicka. “As a result, HRSG duct burners are likely to be more expensive than those used in natural gas-based HRSGs.”</p>
<p>Rentech has provided at least eight HRSGs to companies that want to burn hydrogen, primarily chemical plants that already have a ready supply on site. Some use it to produce more power, others for process steam.</p>
<p>“One had dedicated injectors as the pressure was lower,” said Slepicka. “The other was able to use existing injectors.”</p>
<p>He pointed out that the superheaters will run a little cooler due to all the water that condenses in the HRSG. This impacts heat transfer in the superheater. Hence, those driving a steam turbine may notice a performance hit compared to natural gas. This should be taken into account. If it is a new combined cycle plant, the steam turbine should be sized larger to generate the same amount of power as a 100% natural gas facility.</p>
<p>On the exhaust side, note that hydrogen requires a much higher volume of gas to be passed through the turbine. The HRSG, therefore, needs to be engineered to avoid exceeding the casing’s design pressure. Higher pressure drop can also be a factor in derated performance.</p>
<h2>Safety and Emissions Concerns</h2>
<p>The wider explosion range, lower ignition energy, and lightness of the hydrogen molecule compared to natural gas raises some safety concerns. Any unburned hydrogen will rise to the top of the HRSG and may collect in pockets. Modern HRSG designs generally leave little room for the collection of gas. However, purge cycles may be required to eliminate the risk of explosion. Any facility burning hydrogen should also install hydrogen detection technologies to catch the early signs of leakage.</p>
<p>Water and condensation are further issues. The water dewpoint rises when firing hydrogen. Therefore, cold parts of the HRSG in contact with exhaust gas will form condensation, especially in the back end of the HRSG. Designers should be aware of this phenomenon and ensure that drains and drying measures are implemented as needed.</p>
<p>As for emissions, the main worry is NO<sub>x</sub>. Early experience with hydrogen-based combustion and HRSGs indicates that NO<sub>x</sub> numbers will be higher due to the higher flame temperature of hydrogen. This will be negligible if hydrogen remains at 5% by volume of the overall fuel blend, said Slepicka. Above that, NO<sub>x</sub> will rise and mitigation steps will be needed.</p>
<p>SCR systems are already present in many HRSGs. Once the hot gases have moved through the HRSG and converted water to steam, they need to be mixed with ammonia before being released into the atmosphere to ensure emissions compliance.</p>
<h2>Hydrogen’s HRSG History</h2>
<p>Hydrogen, it turns out, is nothing new in packaged boilers and HRSGs. Packaged boilers have operated with some blend of hydrogen for decades. For example, <a href="https://www.powermag.com/port-arthur-ii-integrated-hydrogencogeneration-facility-port-arthur-texas/">Valero’s Port Arthur refinery in Texas</a>, which produces more than 100 million ft<sup>3</sup>/day of high-purity hydrogen, has added a combined cycle plant with a GE Frame 7EA 80-MW gas turbine. The HRSG is designed for supplemental duct firing up to 550,000 lb/hr and with a ramp rate of 60,000 lb/hr per minute. A steam methane reformer (SMR) hydrogen plant is integrated into the facility to provide additional steam. Exhaust from the gas turbines is used by the HRSG and the SMR. A 20-MW auto-extraction/backpressure steam turbine produces power and exports steam at two different pressures.</p>
<p>“In the coming years, HRSGs will be required to run with hydrogen in increasing frequency,” said Slepicka.</p>
<h2>Retrofit or Replace</h2>
<p>New HRSGs should always be designed to take into account the potential presence of hydrogen. Who wants to buy a HRSG and find out two years later than it requires extensive modification to tolerate hydrogen blends? Room for an SCR should be included as part of this. As emissions of NO<sub>x</sub> will go up as more hydrogen is added, space should be left in new HRSG designs where an SCR can be added in the future, if needed.</p>
<p>“Those wanting to burn hydrogen in the future should set up the HRSG for it upfront,” said Saab. “Those that do receive a hydrogen-ready stamp, that can help with financing and will minimize costs. It is far more difficult to do afterwards.”</p>
<p>But what about the hundreds of HRSGs that already exist? Some are decades old. To be able to operate with hydrogen blends, many will require substantial retrofitting to operate efficiently. Worst case scenario: it may be easier to replace an old HRSG with one specifically designed for hydrogen combustion. Particularly in light of the fact that gas turbine OEMs are intent on introducing more and more hydrogen into their turbines (with 100% being the ultimate goal), newer HRSGs should be specified to cope with hydrogen and older ones should be evaluated based on the best course between retrofit and replace.</p>
<p>“Retrofitting an SCR into existing HRSGs would be extremely challenging,” said Slepicka. “If an older HRSG needs a lot of modification, it might be better to replace it. In any case, many of these units are nearing end of life.”</p>

These issues, in addition to geopolitical tensions, are deeply complex and cannot be addressed on an individual scale.</p>
<p>In addition, the energy industry faces major challenges pertaining to communication given that the workforce and equipment operate in remote and harsh environments. With assets and personnel continuously on the move in areas that lack traditional methods of connectivity, it can be difficult to monitor productivity and access field data. This, in turn, can impact other critical events or environmental compliance standards, as well as emergency response safeguards.</p>
<p>While individual businesses cannot strengthen the global supply chain independently, solve the labor shortage, or reconcile international relations, fortunately, the latter set of issues related to connectivity can be ameliorated. Where terrestrial cellular coverage falls short, satellite connectivity prevails. With satellite coverage, continuous connectivity can be ensured for remote asset tracking, asset management, secure communications at exploration sites, monitoring transmission and deliveries tracked by internet of things (IoT) infrastructure, and worker safety for improved business efficiencies.</p>
<p>Given the current strain on the energy industry, it’s imperative to save costs and increase productivity whenever possible. Certain challenges may be uncontrollable, but issues such as visibility, connectivity, and communication can undoubtedly be addressed and doing so will result in significant benefits for business owners, employees, and customers alike.</p>
<h2>Satellite IoT in Action</h2>
<p>Satellite IoT refers to the use of satellite communication networks and services to connect terrestrial IoT sensors and IoT end-nodes to a server. IoT enables interconnectivity between objects such that they can communicate and relay orders without requiring human-to-human or even human-to-computer interaction. The type of information relayed depends upon the specific IoT sensor, which is determined based on the use case.</p>
<p>As a concept, it can be challenging to grasp how revolutionary this technology can be for the energy sector. While continuous, dependable connectivity and asset management sound useful, how exactly is the value realized? There are an infinite number of ways that satellite IoT can be implemented; the limit of its applications is constrained only by the limit of the imagination.</p>
<p>Take cathodic protection (CP), for example. CP systems keep corrosion under control, thus protecting the millions of miles of metallic pipelines that carry petroleum products, natural gas, water, and wastewater throughout our communities. However, to continue to be effective, these systems must eventually be replaced. Traditionally, site inspections by pipeline personnel are required multiple times per year. With thousands of miles of pipelines running through remote territory, a significant amount of time must be devoted to staffing time and travel costs.</p>
<p>However, with satellite IoT, CP systems can be monitored wirelessly for pipeline operators around the world. The satellite IoT device provides continuous performance monitoring with automated alerts to unusual conditions or failure, and the ability to test remotely. Furthermore, technicians can use any web-enabled device to access a cloud platform to see where CP systems are operating normally and to download performance data, generate reports, and remotely modify device configurations.</p>
<p>Another prevalent application for satellite IoT in the energy industry is oil tank monitoring. To maintain oil production, the fluid levels in storage tanks at a drill site require regular monitoring. Legacy measurement systems are complicated, costly to install and calibrate, and often require personnel to check gauges by hand. Tank monitoring is increasingly being handled remotely, but for drilling rigs on the move, cellular connection is unreliable.</p>
<p>Satellite enabled IoT tools can illuminate data on tank levels including GPS coordinates, allowing drilling companies and their vendors to see all tanks, establish automatic alerts when levels are low, and automate dispatch of supply trucks to refill the tanks. Smart data processing on edge devices allows for limited data transmission when tanks require no action and the condensation of data into short messages, therefore reducing transmission costs. Drilling companies can effectively save thousands of unnecessary hours and ensure that fluids are always available to support uninterrupted operation.</p>
<p>These examples are just a sample of the litany of ways in which satellite IoT technology can be leveraged throughout the energy sector.</p>
<h2>Continuous Connectivity Meets Customization</h2>
<p>To truly grasp the dependability of satellite connectivity, it’s important to understand that this technology is relied upon to save thousands of lives each year. For personnel working in remote locations, satellite messengers can be used to share information on location and status in case of an emergency. If thousands are willing to utilize satellite communications when their lives are at stake, every business owner should have peace of mind when it comes to using the same technology to monitor and manage their equipment, fleets, or assets.</p>
<p>In addition to reliability, satellite IoT solutions can be customized to suit specific needs or use cases. Embedded satellite IoT chips can integrate with a wide range of hardware based on application needs. However, the true breadth of customization is realized on the software end of IoT.</p>
<p>With certain devices and enablement platforms, instead of custom-coding for specific device hardware, developers can, utilizing a low-code platform, hardware abstraction, and unified APIs, seamlessly interface between application and capabilities of the satellite IoT edge device. By developing artificial intelligence (AI)-driven applications that send smart data from the edge, energy businesses can effectively reduce the transmission fee associated with sending data from the IoT device to the endpoint, or server, and improve operational performance.</p>
<p>Flexibility is also a useful attribute of satellite IoT solutions. Say, for instance, an organization is looking to expand its IoT capabilities, additional sensors can deliver valuable new capabilities quickly and easily by using Bluetooth connectivity. Furthermore, if a business would benefit from machine learning and executable files to improve the performance of systems in the field, the right IoT partner will have the storage and processing power necessary to run applications at the edge, and the platform to simplify configuration, application development, and device management.</p>
<p>As society continues to advance along with technology, many are looking to renewable energy options in addition to traditional energy sources like oil and gas. These energy production methods are also often located in remote areas and would benefit from satellite IoT as much as any other organization that has people and assets located in isolated areas.</p>
<p>The beauty of satellite IoT is that it will work for you, regardless of your specific needs or geographical location. For those who operate in remote areas that stand to gain from improved visibility, reliability, reduced cost, and repurposed employee hours, consider satellite IoT to help meet the current demands of the energy sector.</p>

<p>DTEK, a diversified energy company that generates and distributes electricity in Ukraine, issued a call to “Western partners” for the immediate supply of various pieces of electrical equipment to restore power in its service territory.</p>
<p>Russian missile attacks on DTEK energy facilities on Oct. 18 killed at least one employee and injured at least seven more, while also destroying civil and energy infrastructure. The company reported that since the full-scale invasion began, 87 DTEK employees have been killed, 210 injured, 15 held captive, and one is missing.</p>
<p>“Russia is once again resorting to energy terrorism that may lead to a total destruction of Ukraine energy sector, leaving millions of people deprived of heat and energy supply before and through the winter,” DTEK CEO Maxim Timchenko said in a statement issued to <em>POWER</em>.</p>
<p>Over the past week, several of DTEK’s energy facilities have been attacked by Russian forces. On Oct. 10 and 11, three of the company’s thermal power plants (TPPs) came under attack. Another TPP got attacked on Oct. 17, and two additional attacks occurred on Oct. 18 at DTEK Energy enterprises. DTEK reported that more than 30% of Ukraine’s energy system has been damaged (Figure 1) as a result of shelling by the Russian army.</p>

<p>Ontario Power Generation (OPG) and Czech Republic-based ČEZ are collaborating to advance deployment of nuclear technology, including small modular reactors (SMRs). The companies said they signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on Oct. 11, with an aim to “reduce financial, technical and schedule risk to both parties on their respective future projects.”</p>
<p>OPG is Ontario’s largest electricity generator. The company has 75 generating stations in the province with a combined capacity of more than 18 GW. In addition to 66 hydroelectric facilities, its fleet includes two nuclear stations—the 3.5-GW Darlington facility and the 3.1-GW Pickering station (Figure 1). OPG says nuclear power provides about 60% of Ontario’s power today.</p>
<figure id="attachment_179016" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179016" style="width: 700px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-179016" src="https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/pickering-nuclear-power-plant-opg.jpeg" alt="" width="700" height="466" srcset="https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/pickering-nuclear-power-plant-opg.jpeg 700w, https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/pickering-nuclear-power-plant-opg-300x200.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-179016" class="wp-caption-text"><em>1. Pickering Nuclear Generating Station is a power plant located on the north shore of Lake Ontario. It consists of eight CANDU reactors. Since 2003, two of the units have been defueled, while the other six units remain operational. Courtesy: OPG</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>“Ontario Power Generation is a world-class nuclear operator, with decades of experience in providing safe, clean, reliable nuclear power,” OPG President and CEO Ken Hartwick said in a statement. “Working together with entities like ČEZ, we can leverage our combined experience to develop and build the new technology needed to power the future and meet decarbonization goals.”</p>
<p>ČEZ is one of Europe’s largest energy companies. Both OPG and ČEZ have committed to achieving net zero goals by 2040, and they believe advanced reactor technology can help in that mission.</p>
<h2>Darlington SMR</h2>
<p>Under the MOU, OPG and ČEZ will share information related to the deployment of new nuclear projects. OPG has said new nuclear generation, including SMRs, is “an essential part of the electricity mix needed to decarbonize the energy sector and broader economy.” OPG is in the process of deploying an SMR at its Darlington site and has already received approval of an Environmental Assessment.</p>
<p>In December 2021, OPG said it would work with GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy on the Darlington SMR project. GE Hitachi’s BWRX-300 (Figure 2) is a 300-MWe water-cooled, natural circulation SMR with passive safety systems. It is the 10th evolution of GE’s boiling water reactor (BWR). The company says the BWRX-300 represents the simplest and most innovative BWR design since it began developing nuclear reactors in 1955.</p>

<p>On March 10 this year, OPG announced it had awarded a $32 million contract to E.S. Fox Limited for the first phase of site preparation and support infrastructure for the Darlington SMR project. Among the infrastructure work expected to be completed under the contract is bringing water, electrical power, information technology, and roads to the site. The Darlington SMR is expected to be operational by the end of this decade.</p>
<h2>ČEZ’s Nuclear Fleet</h2>
<p>ČEZ is no stranger to nuclear power either. It currently operates two nuclear power plants (NPPs) in the Czech Republic. The four-unit Dukovany site (Figure 3) was the first NPP built on Czech territory, and, according to the company, it is “one of the largest, most reliable, and economically advantageous energy sources” in ČEZ’s fleet. Dukovany is located 30 kilometers (km) southeast of Třebíč. It produces about 20% of the total electricity consumption in the Czech Republic.</p>
<figure id="attachment_179011" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179011" style="width: 700px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-179011" src="https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/dukovany-npp.jpeg" alt="" width="700" height="472" srcset="https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/dukovany-npp.jpeg 1024w, https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/dukovany-npp-300x202.jpeg 300w, https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/dukovany-npp-768x518.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-179011" class="wp-caption-text"><em>3. The Dukovany Nuclear Power Plant, with an installed capacity of 2,040 MW, is the second-largest nuclear power plant in the Czech Republic. Courtesy: ČEZ</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Dukovany plant has four VVER 440 model V 213 pressurized water reactors (PWRs). The individual units were put into operation between 1985 and 1987. The original total installed electrical capacity was 1,760 MW, but output has been gradually increased through turbine upgrades, efficiency programs, and technical improvements. Today, the power plant has an installed capacity of 2,040 MW.</p>
<p>ČEZ also operates the dual-unit Temelin NPP, which is situated about 24 km from the South Bohemian capital České Budějovice. Temelin has two VVER 1000 Type V 320 PWRs. The units entered operation in 2000 and 2003, respectively. The station generates roughly the same electricity annually as the Dukovany plant.</p>
<h2>A Partnership with Potential</h2>
<p>Like OPG, ČEZ has taken first steps toward expanding its nuclear fleet at both Temelin and Dukovany. “As a company, we are focused on developing new energy solutions and technologies,” Tomáš Pleskac, member of the Board of Directors and chief of the New Energy Division with ČEZ, said in a statement. “We are preparing for the construction of a new nuclear unit in Dukovany and the upcoming allocation of space at Temelín, where the first SMR could be built in the first half of the next decade. The collaboration with OPG is therefore, for us, a logical step forward.”</p>
<p>“Ontario is proud to lead the way on clean nuclear technologies,” Ontario’s Energy Minister Todd Smith, said in a statement. “With our robust nuclear supply chain and talented workforce, we are ready to support the global deployment of our nuclear expertise that will help reduce emissions while delivering energy security to the world.”</p>

<p>A consortium comprised of Brookfield Renewable Partners, together with its institutional partners, and Cameco Corp. announced on Oct. 11 an agreement to acquire Westinghouse Electric Co. from Brookfield Business Partners (BBU). The deal has a total enterprise value of about $8 billion, including proceeds from the disposition of a non-core asset expected to be received prior to closing the transaction. The deal is expected to be finalized in the second half of 2023, subject to customary closing conditions and approvals.</p>
<p>Westinghouse has a long and storied history in the energy industry dating back more than a century. The company was a pioneer in the nuclear power industry, and it continues to be a major player in the sector today.</p>
<p>Westinghouse has four key business lines. Operating Plant Services provides recurring services for outages and maintenance, engineering solutions, and replacement components and parts. Nuclear Fuel offers long-term contracting for the manufacturing and installation of fuel assemblies and other ancillary equipment across multiple light water reactor technologies, including as the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) for approximately half the nuclear plants worldwide. Energy Systems designs, engineers, and supports the development of new nuclear reactors. Environmental Services provides services to government and commercial customers that support nuclear sustainability, environmental stewardship, and remediation.</p>
<p>“This is the start of an exciting new chapter for the Westinghouse team and for nuclear power,” Patrick Fragman, president and CEO of Westinghouse, said in a statement. “We are grateful to BBU for its stewardship and investments that have strengthened Westinghouse’s position in the nuclear power industry, and more broadly in the clean power world, for the long-term. Now we are proud to join Brookfield Renewable and Cameco, reaffirming the important role played by Westinghouse and nuclear power in enabling the world’s clean energy transition and energy security goals.”</p>
<p>Brookfield Renewable operates one of the world’s largest publicly traded, pure-play renewable power platforms. Its portfolio consists of hydroelectric, wind, solar, and storage facilities in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia, and totals approximately 24 GW of installed capacity with approximately 100 GW more in its development pipeline. Cameco, meanwhile, is one of the largest global providers of uranium fuel. It claims to have a competitive advantage based on its “controlling ownership of the world’s largest high-grade reserves and low-cost operations.” Its headquarters are in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada.</p>
<p>After giving effect to the transaction, Brookfield Renewable and other affiliates of Brookfield Asset Management Inc. will own a 51% interest in Westinghouse and Cameco will own 49%. Brookfield Renewable said it is “pursuing this opportunity through the Brookfield Global Transition Fund I, which is the largest fund in the world focused on the clean energy transition.” </p>
<p>Westinghouse was acquired by BBU out of bankruptcy in 2018. In early July this year, Westinghouse announced organizational and structural changes designed “to further drive the company’s growth strategy and enhance customer engagement.” Notably, the company created a dedicated Global Markets organization and realigned its portfolio of installed fleet services into two global business units with responsibility for Operating Plant Services and Nuclear Fuel. Several personnel changes were also made in leadership positions at the time.</p>
<p>“These are the right steps at the right time for Westinghouse,” Fragman said in a statement released on July 5. “We are bolstering our global approach to meet the extraordinary market opportunities and enhance our responsiveness to our customers.”</p>
<p>BBU claims Westinghouse’s profitability nearly doubled under its ownership. “Today the business is ideally positioned to benefit from strong industry tailwinds driven by increased recognition of nuclear power as a reliable source of clean energy to achieve global decarbonization goals,” it said.</p>
<p>“We have significantly enhanced the business’ operations over the past four years, increasing its margins and strengthening its global leadership position. Westinghouse is an exceptionally well-run business today and has a great future,” Cyrus Madon, CEO of BBU, said in a statement. When combined with distributions received to date, BBU said it expects proceeds to be approximately six times its invested capital—roughly a $4.5 billion total profit.</p>
<p>The consortium, however, believes Westinghouse’s business is poised for further growth. “Westinghouse is well positioned to increase business in its core fuel and services segments, execute on the growing pipeline for extending and uprating nuclear power plants, and service the rising demand for new utility-scale and modular baseload nuclear power generation,” the group said.</p>
<p>Westinghouse provides services to about half of the nuclear power generation sector. The company has significant intellectual property and a specialized workforce of about 9,000 employees capable of operating in markets around the world. Approximately 85% of Westinghouse’s revenue has come from long-term contracted or highly recurring customer service provisions, with a nearly 100% customer retention rate, according to the consortium. The group said given Westinghouse’s comprehensive services offerings and position as an OEM, it has “stability in all macroeconomic environments.”</p>
<p>In a statement, Tim Gitzel, president and CEO of Cameco, said, “We’re witnessing some of the best market fundamentals we’ve ever seen in the nuclear energy sector. As one of the few forms of electricity generation capable of safely, reliably and affordably producing emissions-free, baseload power, nuclear energy is becoming increasingly important in a world that prioritizes electrification, decarbonization and energy security. The opportunity to partner with Brookfield Renewable, a leader in the clean-energy space, to acquire Westinghouse is expected to create a platform for growth across the nuclear value chain. Coupled with our more than 30-year proven track record of providing secure and reliable fuel supplies to a global customer base, this transaction fits perfectly within Cameco’s strategy and is expected to increase our ability to meet the growing needs of existing and new customers at a time when origin and security of supply is of significant concern. At the same time, we expect the recurring demand for Westinghouse’s operating plant services and nuclear fuel will generate a strong revenue stream and add stable cash flow to complement Cameco’s existing uranium and fuel services business.”</p>
<p>Said Connor Teskey, CEO of Brookfield Renewable, “Westinghouse has successfully refocused on providing core services to the nuclear industry and is ready for the next phase of growth. The business aligns well with our existing portfolio, delivering highly contracted and dependable revenue by serving customers who operate critical clean energy assets. Partnering with Cameco brings deep nuclear sector expertise, alongside our knowledge of energy markets and global customer base, to form a formidable champion for nuclear power. We see significant potential to grow the business and deliver on broader growth in the nuclear power sector through our strategic partnership with Cameco.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Pilsen, Czech Republic (Oct. 10, 2022)</strong> – Pilsen-based steam turbine producer Doosan Škoda Power has signed a contract with the company Elektrárny Opatovice (EOP) to replace a TG3 steam turbine. The continuing upgrade is expected to improve the quality and reliability of heat and power supply and contribute to better environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Doosan Škoda Power won the contract in a tender process. Doosan Škoda Power’s experience in applications for steam-gas and fossil power plants, cogeneration, nuclear and solar power plants, biomass incineration plants, waste-to-energy plants, etc. played a key role in its success in the tender. “The upgrade of the entire TG3 heating plant was a challenge for us, particularly in terms of the complexity of the scope of the job and the power plant’s requirements for the technical design of the work. Following on the recent TG5 plant upgrade that we successfully completed for EOP, this work on TG3 is another significant commitment to the client,” says Tomáš Bayer, Sales Manager at Doosan Škoda Power.</p>
<p>Through the project, Doosan Škoda Power will supply a new state-of-the-art condensing steam turbine providing 65 MWe (megawatt electric) to 140 MWt (megawatt thermal), including all accessories such as control systems, a condenser, low pressure regenerative feedwater heating equipment, block transformer, oil management equipment, interconnecting piping, control system, high pressure hydraulic system, field equipment, etc.</p>
<p>TG3 is the second most important turbine for heat supplies after TG5. The refurbishment of the unit will take place as part of the planned turbine shutdown in 2023 and the turbine will become fully operational again in 2024. The planned 15% increase in efficiency will result in a positive environmental impact and reduced energy consumption.</p>
<p>“The upgrade will significantly increase the efficiency of combined heat and power generation,” says Stanislav Ondráček, Head of Strategic Development at EOP, adding that the project is one of key upgrade projects at the plant in addition to the planned decarbonisation and switch to natural gas, and will thus play a key role in combined heat and power generation.</p>
<p>The Opatovice Power Plant is an important producer of electricity and heat in the East Bohemia region. It supplies heat to nearly 63,000 customers in Pardubice, Hradec Králové, Chrudim and other towns and villages in the region.</p>
