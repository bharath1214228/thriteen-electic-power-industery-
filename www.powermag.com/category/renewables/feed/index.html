<p>U.S. utilities need to be proactive in adapting to the changing environment. To minimize the impact of worsening peak loads and a variable energy mix, they need to make strategic decisions and measures to manage future risks posed by key levers.</p>
<p>While the IRA offers incentives for renewable energy sources, clean hydrogen, carbon capture and sequestration, electric vehicles (EVs), heat pumps for homes, and more, transmission infrastructure was much smaller (about $3 billion) and may need expansion with future outlays, whereas funding for cybersecurity, a major concern for utilities, was non-existent (Figure 1).</p>
<figure id="attachment_179285" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179285" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-179285" src="https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/fig1-partners-in-performance.jpg" alt="Partners-in-Performance" width="720" height="480" srcset="https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/fig1-partners-in-performance.jpg 720w, https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/fig1-partners-in-performance-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-179285" class="wp-caption-text"><em>1. Key aspects of Inflation Reduction Act. Courtesy: Partners in Performance</em></figcaption></figure>
<h2>Utilities Are Left with the Bill</h2>
<p>Although the IRA addresses climate change, the electrification trend it accelerates will likely exacerbate issues already facing utilities.</p>
<p><strong>Worsening Duck Curve.</strong> Prior to the IRA, peak demand was forecasted to increase 20% to 30% by 2030 for regions of the U.S. with high EV penetration rates. The IRA incentives for purchasing an EV will likely intensify this “duck curve” phenomenon, leading to an increased peak demand of 30% to 40% by 2030. Greater heat pump penetration is also predicted, but unlike EVs the effect from these appliances will not be as concentrated during peak load times.</p>
<p><strong>More Variable Generation Mix.</strong> By 2030, variable renewable sources, wind and solar, will make up approximately 25% to 30% of grid power compared to today’s 13%. By contrast, the two largest sources of firming power, natural gas and coal, will decline to 40% to 48% from today’s roughly 60%.</p>
<p>Coal’s decline is much discussed, but natural gas is also set to decline in relative share (30% to 32% from 35%). This is largely driven by the reduction in demand over the past 15 years, whereas demand for renewable sources has steadily increased. With renewables becoming more economical, downward pressure is put on natural gas infrastructure investment. Many U.S. cities are already phasing out natural gas in new construction to “green” their grids, eroding baseload capacity and making grids more dependent on variable sources of energy supply.</p>
<p><strong>Tying It All Together.</strong> Grid power variability becomes clearer when combined with the duck curve effect. As peak loads spike, grids have less baseload capacity to rely on and risk not meeting demand during daily peaks (Figure 2).</p>
<figure id="attachment_179286" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179286" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-179286" src="https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/fig2-partners-in-performance.jpg" alt="Partners-in-Performance" width="720" height="443" srcset="https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/fig2-partners-in-performance.jpg 720w, https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/fig2-partners-in-performance-300x185.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-179286" class="wp-caption-text"><em>2.

<h2>Flipping the Right Switch</h2>
<p>Utilities must decide which levers are the most effective in addressing the concerns of these emerging market dynamics, from worsening peak loads to more variable energy mix.</p>
<h3>Lever 1: Generation and Storage Technologies to Deliver Clean Stable Power Throughout the Day</h3>
<p>The IRA’s technology-agnostic incentives have broad implications for levelized cost of electricity for established technologies and emerging solutions (Figure 3). This can change how utility’s view generation and storage levers at their disposal while being aware of the need to de-risk many first-of-a-kind technologies.</p>
<figure id="attachment_179287" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179287" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-179287" src="https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/fig3-partners-in-performance.jpg" alt="Partners-in-Performance" width="720" height="480" srcset="https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/fig3-partners-in-performance.jpg 720w, https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/fig3-partners-in-performance-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-179287" class="wp-caption-text"><em>3. Levelized cost of electricity pre- and post-IRA. Courtesy: Partners in Performance</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Wind and Solar Commoditization. </strong>Solar and wind are the most economical sources of generation in many regions and are likely to keep decreasing their cost curves due to the IRA extending existing tax credits and adding “bonuses” for domestic material use and locating sites in low-income and fossil-fuel dependent/impacted communities.</p>
<p><strong>Storage Increasingly Viable as Pairing with Variable Renewables.</strong> Existing lithium-ion technology paired with wind and solar becomes cost-effective in helping mitigate the intermittency of these energy sources—even if battery technology is not ideal for grid-scale use. Iron-phosphate (LFP) and flow batteries become more attractive alternatives as they mature technologically. More so, early-stage development zinc-based batteries from Canada-based e-Zinc have expanded storage duration to 50 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Geothermal Showing Promise as Firming Power Alternative.</strong> Conventional geothermal stands to benefit from cost reductions. The coming advances in geothermal, with companies like Eavor developing closed-loop systems and Sage Geosystems testing enhanced geothermal systems with the hope to widen applicability into regions thought to be ill-suited for the technology, could broaden technological adoption to provide clean baseload power and support grid reliability.</p>
<p><strong>Hydrogen Blends and Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) with Combined Cycle Gas Turbines (CCGTs) Will Need to Advance Quickly to be Impactful.</strong> While natural gas still has a key role in providing firming power, this will likely change with battery and geothermal technology becoming more viable and cost competitive. CCUS and hydrogen blending paired with CCGT—although theoretically promising with the new IRA incentives—needs to advance in technological readiness to be considered a utility-scale option.</p>
<h3>Lever 2: Transmission &amp; Distribution (T&amp;D) to Shift Electricity Demand and Prevent Outages</h3>
<p>Utilities have other downstream levers to mitigate the effects of increased electrical demand and potential grid instability from renewable intermittency.</p>
<p>Addressing discharge to grid, an emerging EV model uses time-of-use (TOU) rates and demand response (DR) programs to shift electricity usage to off-peak times. For TOU rates, utilities offer options with enough price difference between off-peak and peak times to encourage EV owners to shift charging to lower-cost periods. DR programs, a comparatively mature lever, have become more accessible to customers, with utilities incentivizing the installation of DR-enabling technologies and embracing third-party programs to manage thermostats, water heaters, and EVs in response to TOU rates.</p>
<p>With the rise of distributed energy resources (DERs), opportunities are emerging for virtual power plants (VPPs) to support better demand response by the grid. One example is Google-backed OhmConnect’s platform, providing customers incentives and benefits to organize electricity usage to avoid high-risk times by integrating appliances and devices from 30 companies and manufacturers.</p>
<p>Once a critical mass of DERs is reached, community microgrids can increase resiliency by disconnecting (“islanding”) and reconnecting to the overall grid. Critical infrastructure like hospitals and government facilities have successfully established microgrids to reduce energy spend and ensure continuity during extreme weather events. Utilities can be proactive by helping shape which customers adopt what technology in a particular service area.</p>
<p>Major investment in “traditional” T&amp;D infrastructure is still needed. The American Society for Civil Engineers reports funding gaps of $95 billion for distribution alone by 2025 (more than two times the gap seen in transmission). Hardening infrastructure is another option to ensure grid resiliency as extreme weather events become commonplace. To illustrate, Florida’s three major utilities—Florida Power &amp; Light, Duke Energy Florida, and Tampa Electric Co.—recently filed proposals for a combined $566 million in undergrounding, hardening of electrical systems, and vegetation management in response to more intense hurricanes.</p>
<h3>Lever 3: Cybersecurity to Help Prevent Breaches and Outages</h3>
<p>Cybersecurity concerns affect the entire utility value chain and are likely to increase in importance as grid infrastructure expands, the variety of assets on the grid increases, and as the two-way flow of information between utility and customer increases.</p>
<p>Cybersecurity is already a critical issue for utilities as data breach costs reach a high of $9.44 million with ransomware attacks increasing by 50% in two years. Recent attacks on the Colonial Pipeline and a Florida water treatment plant are two examples. Utilities must put cybersecurity at the center of designing, building, and operating their infrastructure.</p>
<h3>Lever 4: Regulatory Refinement to Support Grid Flexibility and Infrastructure Development</h3>
<p>As both the ownership model and role of utilities evolves, the regulatory environment must align with them. Utilities need to consider how to engage the stakeholder ecosystem to shape policy and meet customer needs for safe, reliable, affordable, and equitable power.</p>
<p><strong>Ownership.</strong> Many utilities are adopting a “shared responsibility model” in EV charging infrastructure, with utilities providing capital for “make-readies” and the interconnection review process, while private charging companies own and operate charging stations. Utilities benefit from this partnership by protecting their system reliability and using the providers’ data to optimize charging. Pepco, Eversource Energy, Georgia Power, and Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&amp;E) use this model, with PG&amp;E having a dedicated EV team who significantly improved interactions with its third-party electricity provider, EVgo.</p>
<p><strong>Role of Utility.</strong> The traditional role of utilities is shifting from building and maintaining infrastructure to orchestrating energy resources for optimized safety and affordability by utilizing cleaner and more affordable resources. For utilities to succeed in this new role, they need to leverage existing regulation, where possible, while learning from other markets on how to best shape policy in their own territories. One example is redefining how pilots are deployed. Connecticut’s Public Utilities Regulatory Authority (PURA) built an “innovation pilots” framework for scaling pilots or ending them—potentially limiting spend on projects not providing a return/benefit to rate payers.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The IRA offers new incentives for renewable energy development and electrification, while bringing fresh challenges for utilities and exacerbating existing ones. It could leave utilities with the bill for potentially worsening duck curves and more variable energy mix.</p>
<p>To ensure their future success, utilities must apply the right levers to address emerging market dynamics and their changing roles (Figure 4). The price of inaction means massive disadvantages by falling behind in energy transition and delivering inferior services, which could result in serious reputational damage with customers flocking to alternatives. Those who do act and leverage the right solutions will solidify their primacy as leaders in a rapidly changing market.</p>

The Dept. of Interior (DOI) on Oct. 18 said it would hold the event on Dec. 6, in an effort to spur industry growth in the waters of the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>The agency said the sale will include five lease areas encompassing 373,268 acres off the northern and central coasts of California. The Biden administration has made offshore wind an important part of its climate change and jobs creation plans, with a goal of deploying at least 30 GW of offshore wind power generation capacity by 2030. The White House in September said it expects the industry will support 77,000 jobs by the end of the decade.</p>
<p>California officials <a href="https://www.powermag.com/california-sets-goals-for-buildout-of-offshore-wind/">earlier this year set a goal</a> of installing as much as 5 GW of offshore wind this decade, and 25 GW by 2045. Developers already are <a href="https://www.powermag.com/report-touts-huge-potential-of-offshore-wind/">building projects off the U.S. East Coast</a>, though the U.S. offshore wind industry has been slower to grow than its <a href="https://www.powermag.com/norway-setting-strategy-for-offshore-wind/">European counterpart</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The demand and momentum to build a clean energy future is undeniable,&#8221; Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said in a statement Tuesday. &#8220;We are taking another step toward unlocking the immense offshore wind energy potential off our nation&#8217;s West Coast.&#8221; The DOI said large-scale projects in the lease areas could provide as much as 4.5 GW of power generation. The agency said the projects would likely use wind turbines on floating platforms, since water depths along the outer continental shelf in the Pacific preclude the use of turbines fixed to the ocean floor.</p>
<p>The Biden administration earlier this year announced an &#8220;Energy Earthshot&#8221; program, creating a new Floating Offshore Wind Shot &#8220;to accelerate breakthroughs across engineering, manufacturing, and other innovation areas.&#8221; The program has a goal to reduce the costs of floating offshore wind technologies by more than 70% by 2035, to $45 per megawatt-hour, according to the administration.</p>
<h2>35 GW of Generation Capacity</h2>
<p>The DOI has said it wants at least 35 GW of offshore wind generation capacity in service by 2035, with Tuesday&#8217;s action designed to help <a href="https://www.powermag.com/offshore-wind-finding-direction-in-u-s/">jump-start the nascent U.S. industry</a>. Haaland said her department is &#8220;moving forward at the pace and scale required to help achieve the president&#8217;s goals to make offshore wind energy, including floating offshore wind energy, a reality for the United States.&#8221; The agency said a formal notice of the December sale will be published this week, and would include details on the qualifications for companies to participate.</p>
<p>Liz Burdock, president and CEO of the Business Network for Offshore Wind, in a statement emailed to <em>POWER,</em> said, &#8220;The future of offshore wind is floating, and today&#8217;s lease auction announcement is another exciting step to advancing the U.S. as a premier market for this cutting-edge industry, which will bring a reliable renewable resource to California&#8217;s power sector. Bolstered both by California&#8217;s long-term goals and the federal government&#8217;s Earth Shot initiative, the West Coast market will singularly rival those on the global stage and could draw billions in U.S. supply chain investments.&#8221;</p>
<p>Burdock, whose group is a non-profit organization supporting the supply chain for offshore wind, along with calling for expanded adoption of the technology, also noted that &#8220;the U.S. must move with urgency to capture this rare economic opportunity by freeing up critical support for port and transmission investments, and do the hard work to identify and build an American supply chain that will anchor the U.S. as a global industry leader.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Lease Areas Identified</h2>
<p>Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) Director Amanda Lefton, speaking Tuesday at the American Clean Power (ACP) Association&#8217;s Offshore WINDPOWER 2022 conference in Providence, R.I., said the lease areas are in the <a href="https://www.powermag.com/california-and-oregon-sail-forward-on-offshore-wind/">Morro Bay and Humboldt Bay wind energy areas</a> off California. Said Lefton, &#8220;Today’s announcement represents years of close coordination and engagement with the state of California, Tribes, ocean users, local communities and all interested parties to move us closer towards achieving the administration’s vision to fight climate change and realizing California’s clean energy future, while creating a domestic supply chain and good-paying union jobs.&#8221;</p>
<p>JC Sandberg, the ACP&#8217;s interim CEO, said, &#8220;This historic announcement marks a significant milestone for offshore wind in this country and on the West Coast. This shows what can happen when we tap into the abundant renewable energy resources we have across the U.S., including along our coastlines. ACP applauds Director Lefton and BOEM’s efforts to develop offshore wind lease sales like the one announced today as California and the country work to meet growing demand and ambitious clean energy goals.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sandberg added, &#8220;This lease sale reflects an all-of-government approach that brought together multiple federal and state agencies. It puts California on a path as a global hub for offshore wind technology that will foster thousands of good-paying American maritime and manufacturing jobs while boosting the domestic offshore wind supply chain.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="left"><strong>CALGARY, Alberta, Oct. 17, 2022 –</strong> TC Energy Corp. announced today a $29.3 million investment in a renewable natural gas (RNG) production facility near the <a href="https://www.jackdaniels.com/en-us">Jack Daniel Distillery</a> in Lynchburg, Tennessee. Owned by Lynchburg Renewable Fuels LLC, the facility will produce RNG with a carbon intensity score that is 50% lower than traditional natural gas, saving up to 16,000 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>e/ year. The project is being developed by 3 Rivers Energy Partners, LLC, also an owner in Lynchburg Renewable Fuels.</p>
<p>Once operational in 2024, a byproduct of the Jack Daniel’s distilling process will be broken down to generate methane gases recovered as biogas. A biogas upgrade plant will remove contaminants to produce pipeline-quality RNG that will be directly connected to a local natural gas utility. Liquid fertilizer will also be produced in the process, processed, stored and distributed to meet local agriculture demand.</p>
<p>“This investment is our first in the production of renewable natural gas,” said Corey Hessen, TC Energy Executive Vice-President and President, Power &amp; Energy Solutions. “The production of RNG onsite at the Jack Daniel Distillery offers TC Energy one more opportunity to meet the challenge of growing energy needs and reducing emissions while providing customers with access to an affordable, reliable source of energy.”</p>
<p>TC Energy will market 100% of the RNG production and environmental attributes, which include renewable identification numbers and low carbon fuel standards.</p>
<p>“Our goal is to create lasting partnerships that give organizations the ability to create a sustainable future by utilizing bio-waste to reduce energy and help sustain local agriculture,” said John Rivers, CEO of 3 Rivers Energy Partners. “What we are doing is a major step for Jack Daniel’s, the local agriculture, and our planet’s future.”</p>
<p>TC Energy and 3 Rivers Energy Partners have also committed to jointly develop future RNG projects.</p>
<p>Since 2002, TC Energy has transported RNG with the current capacity to flow over 30 Bcf annually to market through 17 interconnects across its footprint of thousands of miles of pipelines. This investment marks the company’s first for producing RNG.</p>
<p>The announcement builds upon TC Energy’s ongoing development of its extensive low-carbon energy portfolio, most recently as the company commenced construction in October on <a href="https://www.tcenergy.com/announcements/2022-10-04-tc-energy-to-build-its-first-solar-energy-project-in-canada/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">an 81 MW solar facility in Alberta</a>.</p>

<p>BP on Oct. 17 said it was buying Houston, Texas-based Archaea Energy for $3.3 billion in cash, or $26 a share, along with $800 million for Archaea’s debt. The deal is subject to regulatory approvals and approval by Archaea’s shareholders, with the companies targeting the deal’s closing by year-end. Archaea will operate as a subsidiary within BP after the transaction closes, according to the companies.</p>
<p>“Archaea is a fantastic fast-growing business, and BP will add distinctive value through our trading business and customer reach,” said BP CEO Bernard Looney. “It will accelerate our key bioenergy growth engine, creating a real leader in the biogas sector, and support our net-ero ambition. And, importantly, we’re doing this while remaining focused on the disciplined execution of our financial frame. Investing with discipline into the energy transition, creating further value through integration—this is exactly what BP’s transformation into an integrated energy company is all about.”</p>
<h2>Largest RNG Deal to Date</h2>
<p>The deal is the largest to date in the RNG sector, surpassing Chevron’s $3.15 billion buyout of biodiesel maker Renewable Energy Group earlier this year. It’s BP’s largest acquisition since Looney took over as the company’s chief executive in early 2020. Looney at the time said he would grow BP’s renewable energy business and move to decarbonize the company’s operations, in part by cutting emissions from its oil and gas production sector.</p>

<p>RNG, also called biogas, is gas that is captured from organic waste in landfills or farms. Archaea operates 50 RNG and landfill gas-to-energy facilities across the U.S., and has a development pipeline of more than 80 projects. The company earlier this year announced a joint venture with Republic Services, a waste disposal group, to develop 40 RNG projects across the U.S. The groups said that joint venture will convert landfill gas into pipeline-quality RNG that can be used for a variety of applications to displace conventional natural gas.</p>
<p style="padding: 2px 6px 4px; color: #555555; background-color: #eeeeee; border: 2px solid #dddddd; text-align: center;"><strong>The Jack Daniel Distillery in Tennessee is <a href="https://www.powermag.com/press-releases/tc-energy-3-rivers-energy-partners-to-develop-renewable-natural-gas-production-facility-at-jack-daniel-distillery/">embarking on a $29.3 million renewable natural gas</a> project. </strong></p>
<p>BP has said it wants to substantially grow Archea’s RNG output. Looney said the expectation is to grow production at least fivefold by 2030, to about 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed). BP’s current biogas business produces about 11,000 boed.</p>
<h2>Biogas Investment</h2>
<p>Looney on Monday said biogas “is a product that our customers want,” as more groups—particularly transportation companies—use biogas as a lower-carbon fuel. &#8220;There’s more demand for this product today than there is supply,” Looney said, also noting that biogas sector is expected to grow “25 fold by 2050.” Looney said BP plans to invest $1.7 billion in its biogas business over the next five years.</p>
<p>“Archaea was founded with a mission to build the world’s leading RNG development company to reduce global emissions and make multi-generational sustainability impacts. In a very short period of time, we have rapidly become a leading RNG platform in the U.S., and today’s announcement will further enable this business to realize its full potential,” said Nick Stork, Archaea’s CEO and co-founder. “BP is a world-class partner and a strong fit for Archaea, with a strategic focus on bioenergy and an operational history in the RNG value chain that is fully aligned with ours and our partners’.”</p>
<p>Stork continued, “We are excited to join [BP] in our mission to increase the role of RNG in helping customers reach their long-term climate goals, and I look forward to our hard-working team joining the BP organization to help achieve their bioenergy objectives. I am incredibly proud of our employees at Archaea who have driven this tremendous value creation and will continue to push forward Archaea’s drive to foster clean energy growth and promote domestic energy reliance.”</p>
<p>Daniel Rice, Archaea’s board chairman, said, “After a thorough review, our board determined that combining Archaea’s RNG assets and our strong development backlog with BP’s existing bioenergy business and deep operational and financial resources is the best way to create a stronger platform to achieve Archaea’s full potential, while maximizing value for our shareholders. Today’s news would not be possible without the entire Archaea organization, our best-in-class employees and our industry partners.”</p>
<h2>Decarbonization</h2>
<p>The companies in a news release said the deal “provides Archaea access to unmatched, world-class platforms, capabilities, and capital resources for acceleration of its growth plans. Archaea’s business will be able to access BP’s trading capabilities and broad customer base, further helping many of BP’s customers achieve their decarbonization goals.” The groups said that Archaea “will be integral to BP’s existing bioenergy business, which has established key positions in the segment and is one of BP’s key transition growth engines, which is anticipated to further Archaea’s growth into international markets.”</p>
<p>BP officials have said the company expects to invest more than 40% of its total capital into its renewable energy and transition businesses by 2025. It expects to spend as much as $16 billion this year, and has said most of its capital expenditure will continue to go toward its oil and gas business.</p>

Market frameworks, volatility and decarbonization efforts have drawn developers en masse to California and Texas, in particular (<strong>Figure 1</strong>). Focusing on Texas (ERCOT), Enverus shows that battery energy storage systems generate the vast amount of their revenue by providing ancillary services. With rapid growth in battery capacity, prices for ancillary services are poised to fall as early as the first quarter of 2023.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Figure 1 | Top 10 States With Operating and Under Construction </strong><strong>Battery Storage Projects</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-178838" src="https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/figure-1.jpg" alt="" width="624" height="330" srcset="https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/figure-1.jpg 624w, https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/figure-1-300x159.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></p>

<p>Currently, storage assets and operators show a preference for providing ancillary services in ERCOT (<strong>Figure 2</strong>) versus an arbitrage strategy (charging when prices are low, discharging when prices are high). Storage assets are well suited to provide ancillary services due to the limited nature of energy storage and the benefit of payments for capacity committed to ancillary services. Since batteries have limited capacity, they have the potential to earn more revenue from ancillary services by running frequent small partial cycles and maintaining their state of charge instead of fully charging and discharging.</p>

<p>Market information shows energy storage assets are mainly following a price-taker approach, banking on the higher marginal costs of coal and gas to make a profit providing ancillary services. As more storage assets enter the market, they will be the predominant technology providing ancillary services and these assets will set the price. When storage assets become the marginal bidder for ancillary services, as they already are for Regulation Up and Regulation Down, there will be a shift from price-taking behavior. <strong>Figure 3</strong> shows operating and proposed storage capacity versus ancillary services requirements over time. Enverus research suggests there are two primary factors that weigh heavily on the bids for ancillary services- cost of capital and cost to charge.</p>

<p>The fall in Regulation Up and Regulation Down price has already occurred. Average Regulation Up prices have dropped by nearly half, from approximately $24/MWh on average in 2021 to $13/MWh in 2022. Over the same period Regulation Down prices have dropped from around $25/MWh to $10/MWh. The timing of the fall corresponds well to when storage started setting the price more often than thermal generators. Enverus data shows that prices for Regulation services are not arbitrary. The prices are in line with cost of capital plus the cost of deployment. Enverus states the cost of deployment correlates well with average low prices often seen during the overnight hours. Enverus also suggests Responsive Reserve and Non-Spinning Reserve will also see prices fall when storage saturates their respective requirements.</p>
<p>In a recent ERCOT Storage Report Series webinar, Juan Arteaga from Enverus Intelligence Research discusses the growing energy storage in the state.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-178869" src="https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ercot-a-hotspot2.png" alt="" width="1765" height="962" srcset="https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ercot-a-hotspot2.png 1765w, https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ercot-a-hotspot2-300x164.png 300w, https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ercot-a-hotspot2-1024x558.png 1024w, https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ercot-a-hotspot2-768x419.png 768w, https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ercot-a-hotspot2-1536x837.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1765px) 100vw, 1765px" /></p>
<p>All these changes add up to significant decreases in gross profit for storage assets pursuing an ancillary services strategy. Estimates indicate the fall could be near 50%, from ~$150,000/MW in 2021 to $72,000/MW by the end of 2023. Still, storage assets should continue to prefer ancillary services strategies relative to a pure arbitrage strategy that only profits ~$40,000/MW per year, assuming intraday spreads of around $110/MWh in ERCOT. The market participants with the largest fleets are mostly niche operators, focusing on storage (<strong>Figure 4</strong>). Enterprise value will certainly be impacted as a result of diminished returns.</p>

<p>Despite diminishing profit margins there is still a call for storage capacity to grow. The <a href="https://knowledgehub.enverus.com/wcc/eh/3095155/lp/3889450/impact-of-the-inflation-reduction-act-of-2022-on-the-energy-industry">Inflation Reduction Act</a> extends investment tax credits to standalone storage projects, something that was previously only available to solar projects. Ongoing volatility in the face of extreme weather events and reliance on intermittent renewables will perpetuate arbitrage opportunities. At the moment, CAISO and ERCOT are the most attractive markets  noted in a <a href="https://www.enverus.com/renewable-power-companies/">2022 Storage Report</a> but Enverus expects other jurisdictions to present ample opportunity as well. Renewable portfolio standards and efforts to decarbonize will also bolster the demand for additional storage capacity on the wholesale grid.</p>

I applaud Congress and the President for working to pass the IRA and taking an important step toward net zero. The passage of this bill is a monumental achievement for everyone who cares about climate change, but many have overlooked a major obstacle to realizing its benefits.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most widely cited <a href="https://repeatproject.org/docs/REPEAT_IRA_Prelminary_Report_2022-08-04.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a> calculating the IRA’s impact comes from Princeton University’s REPEAT project, which concludes that a fully implemented IRA could cut annual U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by about one billion metric tons by 2030, helping drive down carbon emissions 42% from 2005 levels. Those reductions are driven by a massive growth of renewable generation, and the accelerated electrification of transportation, buildings, and industrial loads. On the generation side, renewable energy tax credits and other factors will double the pace of utility-scale wind and solar projects from 20 GW to 39 GW per year by 2025/26. And on the demand side, incentives for electric vehicles (EVs), heat pumps, and other electrification initiatives will drive a massive 65% growth in electricity demand from 2020 to 2035.</p>
<p>However, the study makes a huge simplifying assumption—that there will be enough room on the transmission grid to transport all of those new electrons. The study acknowledges this assumption, stating, “Several constraints that are difficult to model may limit these growth rates in practice, including the ability to site and permit projects at requisite pace and scale, expand electricity transmission … to accommodate new generating capacity … .” It is as if as a country we decide to double the number of cars on the road <u>and</u> increase the average miles driven per car, but overlook the fact that it will result in more traffic jams.</p>
<p>On the grid, there are already traffic jams, referred to as congestion, which have doubled in recent years and cost U.S. consumers a whopping <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-30/trapped-renewable-energy-sends-us-power-prices-below-zero" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$99.7 billion</a> to date in 2022. This occurs when there is insufficient transmission capacity, and typically results in curtailment of cheap renewable energy, and the offsetting dispatch of expensive and dirtier fossil-fueled generation. The IRA will further exacerbate grid congestion, as the bill’s funding and incentives drive the addition of wind and solar farms, heat pumps, and EVs.</p>
<p>In a recent follow-up study, the REPEAT Project authors acknowledge that increasing transmission capacity is key to unlocking the IRA’s benefits. According to their <a href="https://repeatproject.org/docs/REPEAT_IRA_Transmission_2022-09-21.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analysis</a>, U.S. transmission capacity growth needs to more than double from current levels to deliver the projected IRA benefits. If transmission expansion continues on its current trajectory, over 80% of the potential emissions reductions delivered by the IRA in 2030 will be lost.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, building a new transmission line, like building a highway, is an enormously complex infrastructure project, and can take a decade or more. Gaining site control often requires using eminent domain, litigation, and billions in public and private financing. Add securing easements and federal, state, and local permits; design and construction; financing; and vocal local opposition, and it is clear these projects are unlikely to meet the timeframes assumed in the IRA analysis. While legislation has been proposed to streamline the unwieldy state-by-state permitting process, it was not included in the IRA and faces long odds for passage. In summary, it is unlikely and bordering on delusional to believe that enough new transmission can be built to deliver on the promised IRA benefits.</p>
<p>Yet, there is hope. A new class of technologies has emerged in recent years that expands transmission capacity—not through traditional infrastructure projects, but by a new model of grid infrastructure investment, which leverages advanced sensors, power electronics, and analytics. These Grid Enhancing Technologies (GETs) unlock additional capacity on the grid we already have, and have been <a href="https://watt-transmission.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Brattle__Unlocking-the-Queue-with-Grid-Enhancing-Technologies__Final-Report_Public-Version.pdf90.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shown</a> to collectively double the amount of renewable generation that can be interconnected to the grid. Importantly, GETs can be deployed in weeks or months, rather than the five to 10 or more years required for traditional projects, with payback periods of less than 12 months, versus <a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2022-04/Grid%20Enhancing%20Technologies%20-%20A%20Case%20Study%20on%20Ratepayer%20Impact%20-%20February%202022%20CLEAN%20as%20of%20032322.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">14–16 years</a> for traditional projects.</p>
<p>To go back to the highway analogy, GETs are like a smart highway system that dynamically detects the weather and road conditions, and optimizes the speed and route of travel to safely and efficiently route every car to its destination. This may seem like the stuff of science fiction for our highways, but GETs are proven technologies that are being deployed by leading utilities in the U.S. and around the world. GETs include Dynamic Line Rating–based systems (DLRs), which unlock up to 40% additional capacity on existing lines and improve system reliability through continuous monitoring and anomaly detection.</p>
<p>The IRA is a truly historic legislative achievement, and puts us on a path to net zero by decarbonizing the grid and electrifying our energy consumption. But our existing electric power grid stands as a daunting obstacle to realizing the law’s intended benefits, and traditional methods of expanding the grid are simply too slow. Fortunately, by accelerating deployment of GETs to maximize the capacity of our existing grid, we can jump-start the grid expansion needed to ensure that the benefits promised in the IRA are fully realized.</p>

And while perhaps only the most devoted scientists are hosting parties, there is much to celebrate this year. Thanks to innovative industry partnerships and legislative action, green hydrogen projects all over the country are rapidly advancing toward significant financial investment to solve our biggest climate challenges.</p>
<p>America is on the forefront of a generational clean energy transition. Today, more than <a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&amp;t=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20%</a> of U.S. electricity generation comes from renewable resources such as wind, solar, and hydroelectric power; double what it was just a decade ago. Electrification of traditional fossil fuel–emitting sources like automobiles and household heating is beginning to scale.</p>
<p>But there are still major industries like shipping, refining, and steelmaking where batteries and electrification are not a viable solution for decarbonization at scale or over long distances. This is where green hydrogen offers a new clean energy opportunity.</p>
<p>Hydrogen as a fuel source is not new. Currently, hydrogen is used to <a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/hydrogen/use-of-hydrogen.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refine petroleum and process foods</a>, while hydrogen fuel cells power everything from <a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/hydrogen/use-of-hydrogen.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">military equipment to electric power grids</a>. However, while hydrogen burns as a clean fuel source, the existing process to isolate it is anything but. It requires a lot of energy—energy derived from fossil fuels—and is extremely carbon intensive, generating more than <a href="https://www.energypolicy.columbia.edu/research/article/hydrogen-fact-sheet-production-low-carbon-hydrogen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">830 million metric tons of carbon dioxide each year</a>.</p>
<p>But with the rapidly increasing capacity of renewable energy being developed, and the equally rapid cost reductions in the cost of such energy, there is a new opportunity to make hydrogen a truly green fuel. If hydrogen is mass-produced in a green, renewable capacity, it has enormous potential to combat climate change and reduce global emissions.</p>
<p>“Green” hydrogen, so called because the production process uses no fossil fuels and emits no carbon, is produced through a process where renewable electricity powers electrolyzers that create hydrogen. Hydrogen can be used in its gaseous form—but because it is diffuse and difficult to transport, it can alternatively be synthesized into a number of different clean fuels. These green fuels, such as e-methanol, e-kerosene, e-ammonia, and sustainable aviation fuel, can be used to replace fossil fuels and <a href="https://www.tno.nl/en/newsroom/2020/09/fuels-crucial-sustainable-heavy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cut emissions in hard to abate sectors such as road transportation, shipping, and heavy industry</a>. Just imagine replacing the 7,000 tons of diesel—more than 52,000 barrels—burned by a container ship on just one roundtrip voyage from Europe to Asia with clean, emission-less fuel. Now, multiply that by hundreds of ships and thousands of voyages a year, and the benefits to the climate begin to add up quickly.</p>
<p>One of the biggest obstacles to green hydrogen production has been its relatively higher cost compared to grey hydrogen—hydrogen produced with fossil fuels. But as renewable technology has matured in the U.S., the costs of renewable power generation has rapidly declined to the point where the cost of energy generated from new solar and onshore wind is comparable to that of new fossil fuel power plants.</p>
<p>Recent legislative action promises to further drive down the cost of green hydrogen. The Inflation Reduction Act provides an up to $3 per kilogram production tax credit for all hydrogen produced with electrolyzers powered by clean energy. This will allow the industry to rapidly scale up electrolyzer technology within the continental U.S. to mature and grow the industry with a significant positive impact on the cost of green hydrogen in the medium term. And the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act contains $9.5 billion in clean hydrogen initiatives, including $8 billion for Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs that will create jobs, grow the market, and expand the use of clean hydrogen in the industrial sector and beyond.</p>
<p>The other major obstacle to scaling green hydrogen and green fuels is the need for demand from offtakers—industrial customers who will use the fuel to replace fossil fuels. To jumpstart the cycle of supply and demand, private sector companies are forming innovative partnerships needed to make green fuels viable at scale.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, clean energy leader Ørsted <a href="https://us.orsted.com/news-archive/2022/03/orsted-and-maersk-sign-landmark-green-fuels-agreement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signed an agreement</a> with shipping giant AP Møller-Maersk to provide fuels derived from green hydrogen for 12 new Maersk container vessels that will be built to run on e-methanol. The commitment will see Ørsted build 1.2 GW of new renewable energy, the equivalent of roughly 400 new wind turbines, to power a facility on the Gulf Coast that will produce 300,000 tons of e-methanol per year for Maersk’s new vessels. The potential for emissions reductions is significant; Maersk estimates that its fleet of ships alone burn close to 12 million tons of fossil fuel per year. It’s a large-scale challenge that the companies are investing in together to solve.</p>
<p>Bold commitments and actions like these—from the public and the private sector—are exactly what we need to tackle the climate crisis and scale clean energy solutions for our hardest-to-abate sectors. So, this year, on National Hydrogen Day, we can celebrate the potential of H<sub>2</sub>—the smallest molecule on the periodic table—one that just may help us solve some of our biggest challenges.</p>

<p>There have been historic initiatives within the U.S. to create a sustainable energy economy and to address major environmental concerns created by fossil fuels. The Inflation Reduction Act contains $369 billion in climate and energy provisions, which will have a meaningful impact on climate change. Meanwhile, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law seeks to remedy environmental issues caused by inadequate regulation within the oil and gas industry.</p>
<p>The push for the use of renewable energy in the U.S. has created a legislative imbalance across the country. With any new initiative, legislation to regulate industry can be slow and ad hoc. Non-renewable energy, such as nuclear energy, coal, and oil, have been used for centuries, and the industry has become one of the most highly regulated. However, legislation for the decommissioning of plants utilizing these forms of energy has proven to be abysmal.</p>
<h2>Nuclear and Coal Power Plant Decommissioning</h2>
<p>The decommissioning process occurs at the end of plant life after operations cease. The process of decommissioning for non-renewable energy varies, with nuclear plants being the most highly regulated. The regulation for the decommissioning of a nuclear plant is outlined by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and may occur using one of three strategies. These are DECON, immediate dismantling soon after the plant closes; SAFSTOR, often considered “deferred dismantling,” which involves maintaining and monitoring the facility to allow radioactivity to decay over decades; or ENTOMB, contaminants are permanently encased onsite in a material such as concrete. Additionally, to ensure that the decommissioning takes place, the NRC ensures that licensees of sites have sufficient funds for decommissioning with a reporting mechanism in place every two years. Regulation of nuclear sites is crucial, as there could be catastrophic implications for the people and environment, if performed inadequately.</p>
<p>Decommissioning of coal-fired power plants is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Coal-fired power plant decommissioning is not as stringent as a nuclear plant, and involves cleanup and waste removal, remediation, and redevelopment. Many of these plants are retired but have yet to be cleaned up, remediated, and redeveloped because of the sheer cost of carrying out the venture. Instead, many entities seek to sell these plants as-is to an investor with deep pockets that has the wherewithal to remediate and redevelop them in accordance with EPA guidelines.</p>
<p>The funding for coal plant decommissioning costs is largely based on whether the facility is located in a regulated or deregulated state. In deregulated states, such as Pennsylvania, there is no state or federal protection to ensure that there is adequate funding for decommissioning. The cost of decommissioning is included in the cost of doing business. Coal plants can sit for years after shutdown without remediation, such as the 236-acre Hatsfield Ferry Plant, retired in 2013 but demolition and restoration will not be completed until 2024. However, in regulated markets across the U.S., decommissioning is paid by the ratepayer after the utility company provides cost estimates on a recurring basis and regulators approve the expenses. Delays in decommissioning can have negative impacts on the environment and community as a plant sits idle.</p>
<h2>Funding Problems for Oil and Gas Site Decommissioning</h2>
<p>Oil and gas decommissioning, similar to coal-fired plants, is also plagued with abandoned wells that were improperly done, exposing residents to potential pollution that can leach into the soil. Decommissioning of oil wells involves dismantling the facility, plugging and abandoning the well, and restoring the site to its original condition. According to an investigation done by Reuters in 2020, America has more than 3.2 million unplugged abandoned wells, with Pennsylvania having more than 200,000 of those wells.</p>
<p>Federal regulation only governs 10% of the drilling that takes place within the U.S., according to the American Petroleum Institute, while the other 90% takes place on privately owned land governed by state laws and regulations. Many state regulations have proven to be woefully inadequate to cover the costs associated with decommissioning. For example, Texas administrative code requires only a $250,000 performance bond, letter of credit, or cash for 100 or more wells, while the average cost to plug a well ranges from $20,000 to $145,000, according to a Government Accountability Office report focused on the risks associated with insufficient bonds to reclaim wells.</p>
<p>Oil and gas companies have successfully escaped liability due to insufficient bonds, and many at the end of retirement of facilities are bankrupt with the state being left with the financial burden. According to Haynes and Boone LLP, there were 61 oil field service companies that filed for bankruptcy in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Taxpayers have been left bearing the decommissioning liability, while oil and gas entities have eked out all profits from the wells. This resulted in lobbying efforts to have the federal government step in and remedy the situation by providing funding. In January 2022, the Department of the Interior received $1.5 billion through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to commence the plugging and capping of abandoned oil and gas wells, and awarded $560 million to 24 states, including West Virginia and Mississippi, for plugging of wells in August 2022.</p>
<h2>Modern Approach to Decommissioning</h2>
<p>In the age of renewable energy, one could only hope that legislators have learned from the horrors experienced in the decommissioning of non-renewable sites. Many first-generation solar and wind facilities are coming to an end with the average life of panels and turbines ranging from 25 years to 35 years. Like fossil fuels, there is ad hoc legislation relating to the decommissioning of renewable facilities.</p>
<p>Decommissioning of solar panels and wind turbines includes the removal of all panels or turbines, structures, foundations, fencing, roads, and restoring the property to the previous condition. Unlike fossil fuels, remediation is not considered in decommissioning, as many of the panels are recyclable and there is only an issue of environmental contamination if high quantities of lead and cadmium are present.</p>
<p>The federal government, through the Bureau of Land Management, and 19 states have decommissioning legislation for renewable facilities. Pennsylvania is in the process of debating decommissioning legislation. The lack of decommissioning regulations in most states is surprising, as the federal government had to rescue states to plug oil and gas wells. Without adequate decommissioning policies, landowners—mainly in rural areas—could be left with the financial burden of removing the panels.</p>
<p>Most decommissioning legislation has the lessee of the solar farm delivering evidence of financial assurance that it will be able to complete the decommissioning of the site after the useful life of the equipment. The assurance is usually based on the total acreage being used for the solar or wind facility, less the salvaged value.</p>
<p>Although finalizing regulations for decommissioning of renewable energy sites is slow, many of these facilities are not yet retired. Therefore, states have the ability to enact legislation prior to the retirement of wind and solar farms, leading many states to avoid the failures of non-renewable legislation.</p>

<p>Bitcoin mining is the process used to generate new coins and verify new transactions. The process involves vast, decentralized networks of computers around the world that verify and secure blockchains, the virtual ledgers that document cryptocurrency transactions. In return for contributing their computing power, miners are rewarded with new coins. The process ultimately requires a lot of energy to perform, which is where power companies come in.</p>
<p>“Bitcoin mining can help the energy sector,” Andrew Webber, founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.digitalpoweroptimization.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Power Optimization (DPO)</a>, said as a guest on <em>The POWER Podcast</em>. “Instead of just selling power to third-party Bitcoin miners, we suggest, that, in many circumstances, energy companies themselves are actually far better positioned to build their own Bitcoin mines and undertake this strategy and this activity for their own purposes in a vertically integrated way, where again, the energy company owns the Bitcoin mine. And by operating a Bitcoin mine, in conjunction with an energy asset, in an intelligent and thoughtful way, you can really optimize your generation assets in a way that you couldn’t really have done without a tool like Bitcoin mining to help you.”</p>
<p>Webber, who gave a keynote presentation on the Bitcoin mining topic at the co-located <a href="https://www.experience-power.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Experience POWER, Distributed Energy Conference, and HydrogeNext</a> events on Oct. 5 at the Gaylord Rockies Resort &amp; Convention Center in Aurora, Colorado, said the idea came to him while reading a story in the newspaper. “I was reading [a <em>Los Angeles Times</em>] article about the state of California paying the state of Arizona $20 per megawatt-hour to get rid of all of its power. And I said, ‘What is going on? That seems absolutely crazy to me. I&#8217;ll take all of it. You know? I&#8217;ll set up a Bitcoin mine there, and just, any power you don’t want, just send it to me, I’ll take it for free,’ ” he said.</p>
<p>Webber explained how Bitcoin mining can help power companies alleviate issues. “This is a mechanism that can go almost anywhere and soak up this excess available power where it’s produced, and then apply that value elsewhere across the globe in a way that actually solves these problems,” said Webber. “So, it’s quite an interesting tool for the energy sector once they get their heads around how this will help.”</p>
<p>Bitcoin mining provides flexibility, too. If power is needed suddenly for customers, the power company can respond by simply shutting down the mining operation. “You can just turn it off, and so, it makes a really good tool to respond to sharp jumps in demand or transmission difficulties,” Webber said. “It’s sort of energy management infrastructure. And when you start thinking about an energy company building these things, it’s not really Bitcoin mining, you’re managing your energy assets in a different way, using a different system.”</p>
<p>Setting up a Bitcoin mining operation is fairly simple. Webber said a 1-MW system fits in what looks like a standard shipping container—essentially, a 40-foot by 8-1/2-foot big metal box. Inside are racks, wiring, all the networking equipment, a filtration system, cooling fans, and 300 to 325 very specialized computers. The container is connected to a transformer supplied by 240-V or 277-V power, and mining can begin on whatever schedule works best for the power company including 24/7/365.</p>
<p>“You put one of these containers down, five of them, 10 of them, 200 of them, whatever is called for on that specific site for that specific use case,” said Webber. “And you don’t have to do it all at once either. You can scale it over time. Start with a megawatt. Watch it. Make sure it does what we tell you it’s going to do. Six months later, if it’s humming along and you’re happy, build another one, build five more. If you like those, build 50 more. We’ll go look on every asset you own and figure out where these might work. So, you can take a phased approach. You don’t have to go commit to $100 million of spend on day one. You can start slowly. DPO offers free pilots.”</p>
<p>In the end, however, Bitcoin mining is just one tool in a power management toolbox. It can be used in combination with other solutions, including battery storage and green hydrogen production. “All of these are things that need to be incorporated and thought about, not individually, but frankly, in concert with one another,” said Webber. “Right now, I think the energy sector has close to zero understanding that this is available to them, and that’s what we’re hoping to change. And I think it’ll be probably commonplace over the next decade or two.”</p>

<p><em><strong>WattBridge, a relatively new independent power producer that evolved out of a non-OEM aeroderivative gas turbine solutions provider, completed its first power facility based on a standardized LM6000 plant design in January 2021, just weeks ahead of Winter Storm Uri. The design has been replicated in an expanding 2.3-GW fleet purpose-built to furnish the volatile Texas grid with crucial peaking power.</strong></em></p>
<p>Electricity peaking plants, sometimes called peak-lopping plants, have existed since the inception of the interconnected grid, helping to balance the fluctuating power requirements of the electricity grid. As the energy transition has accelerated, bringing with it a massive influx of non-dispatchable variable generation from renewables, more emphasis has grown on the value of flexibility, from minute-to-minute, hour-to-hour, and season-to-season.</p>
<p>In 2018, that value became more critical within the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). The grid operator that serves 90% of Texas <a href="https://www.powermag.com/ercot-anticipates-summer-supply-crunch-amid-units-retirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">warned it was struggling to expand to the summer reserve margin</a>. While the wholesale energy market had seen a proliferation of wind and solar resources—and even recently added a reliability risk desk to closely monitor and respond to wind and solar forecast errors, net load ramps, inertia levels, and ancillary service needs—its summer reserve margin had fallen dramatically to 11%, well below its target of 13.5%. ERCOT pointed to a spate of recent plant retirements, <a href="https://www.powermag.com/monticello-goes-under-more-coal-and-nuclear-imperiled-in-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including major coal baseload generators</a>, for the tight operating conditions.</p>
<p>PROENERGY, a Sedalia, Missouri–based integrated energy service solutions provider, sensed an opportunity. The company has painstakingly built its capabilities in power plant construction, equipment repair, overhaul services, outage response, and turnkey plant operation solutions since its founding in 2002 by President and CEO Jeff Canon. Today, PROENERGY employs more than 500 professionals, has a global experience footprint covering 40 countries, and specializes in services for the LM6000 and LM2500 platforms. Canon, an industry veteran, is specifically fluent in the capabilities of LM6000 aeroderivative gas turbines, owing to his deep experience at some of the nation’s iconic power plants, including as plant manager at Pasco County Cogeneration Facility in Dade City, Florida. <em>POWER</em> recognized that facility as a Top Plant in 1994 for installing the world’s first two GE LM6000 aeroderivative gas turbines.</p>
<p>LM6000PC technology, which now has the benefit of three decades of operational experience, is a quick-start, highly efficient technology that is ideally suited to support renewable balancing, Canon told POWER in September. Derived from GE’s CF6-80C2 high bypass turbofan aircraft engine, the 46.1-MW simple-cycle, two-shaft turbine is still one of the most fuel-efficient in its size class.</p>
<h2>Sensing an Opportunity</h2>
<p>In 2018, however, though cost and market conditions were optimal, a standardized LM6000 power plant package was not available. To fill the market gap, PROENERGY designed a fully engineered and standardized modular peaking plant that could be delivered turnkey and perform reliably with an absolute cost advantage. It rolled out the solution, “PowerFLX,” in 2018, furnishing customers with a single source point—from inception through commercial operation—for building out PowerFLX plants. At the same time, it established a dedicated power generating company, WattBridge, to develop, own, and operate PowerFLX plants. PROENERGY tasked Mike Alvarado, a longtime power plant developer, with leading initial WattBridge opportunities in ERCOT.</p>

<p>While WattBridge isn’t “tied to a single technology,” its mission is to accelerate a reduced carbon energy future. “We have the capabilities, resources, and technical expertise to deliver,” Alvarado told POWER. The company’s most lucrative draw as the transition accelerates and in a cutthroat market like ERCOT is “this really tremendous cost advantage that existed, born out of a pretty unique business model within PROENERGY,” he said.</p>
<p>The PROENERGY cost advantage leverages a full integration, Canon explained. “Unlike a lot of independent power producers who don’t build or operate their own plants, PROENERGY buys raw steel to build packages,” he said. “We actually overhaul the engines ourselves. We have our own repair shops.” PROENERGY, which is not an original equipment manufacturer (OEM), even repurposes machines. These turbines from Pasco, where Canon previously served as plant manager, were purchased by PROENERGY and placed in the WattBridge fleet.</p>
<p>The full integration also pans out to be a major plant development benefit, Alvarado said. “I think PROENERGY is arguably the expert in the world in this technology, both from an equipment standpoint, but also an operation and maintenance and [engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC)] standpoint,” he said. The WattBridge underlying mission is to follow the market in a “reliable, cost-effective, and ultimately a responsible way,” is also a big draw. Investors value responsibility, he noted, and the WattBridge gas power offering caters to energy security by bolstering “market requirements being born out of [renewable] intermittency.”</p>
<h2>A 38-Week Construction Timeframe</h2>
<p>The unique model and its plant install price, which “is significantly less than our competition,” provided a crucial opening in the summer of 2019, when ERCOT wholesale power prices spiked, signaling attractive conditions for new builds, Canon said. WattBridge quickly kicked off the development of its first plant, HO Clarke, a 288-MW peaker in Houston that would be equipped with six LM6000PC units, running at average heat rate of 9,725 Btu/kW. Canon said the primary motivation for PROENERGY to build the plant was to provide a physical “showplace for our product, looking at it as a fully integrated business.” However, its economics are also sound, even while running at an 11.7% capacity factor in its first year, which has increased sharply in 2022. “From a market perspective, we have heat rate call options on the facility, so that underpins the economics,” Canon said.</p>
<p>While the project achieved financial close in December 2019, it received its construction permit in March 2020. “That was the beginning of COVID [disruptions],” recalled Alvarado. “And effectively, what the City of Houston did was convert permitted operations to a remote situation. That slowed us down.” Still, the company spearheaded construction in earnest, and by December 2020—within 38 weeks—it was ready for commissioning.</p>
<p>“That gives you a sense of the value of this business model,” Alvarado said. “It’s just a very compelling advantage that we have in the industry. Timelines in the industry are typically closer to 18 to 24 months if you are doing it in a more traditional procurement way.”</p>
<h2>A Powerhouse During Winter Storm Uri</h2>
<p>The plant’s commercial operation in January 2021 came at a crucial time. In mid-February, Winter Storm Uri unleashed its deadly three-day, statewide freeze, disabling an average 34 GW of generation—nearly half of ERCOT’s all-time winter peak. The newcomer plant remained steadfast on the grid, with all six units providing 141 hours of uninterrupted critical power supplies to public safety infrastructure during the storm’s critical days. The plant’s resilient, weatherized design and its ideal location—on well-established gas infrastructure with firm supply and transport—played an essential role in that achievement.</p>
<p>PROENERGY preparation and expertise was also pivotal, said Alvarado. “We are a fast-start peaker generating station, designed to run in exactly these types of situations,” he said. “Our biggest challenge was keeping our crew fed and sheltered as local hotels closed down within the first 24 hours of the storm. In the end, the crew slept on the control room floor in shifts for five days straight. We are so thankful for their efforts,” he recalled.</p>
<p>HO Clarke’s significant reliability attributes laid the foundation for several sister plants in the Greater Houston area. In fall 2021, WattBridge brought online two more LM6000PCs as part of the 96-MW HO Clarke II project. WattBridge in late 2019 also kicked off development of the two-phase Topaz facility in Galveston County. The seven-unit 336-MW Topaz I began operating in July 2021, and the three-unit 144-MW Topaz II followed within weeks that summer.</p>
<p>In summer 2022, meanwhile, WattBridge put online the six-unit 288-MW Braes Bayou plant in Fort Bend County. The 288-MW Mark One nearby is currently in the commissioning phase, and the company plans to fully commission its next project, the 288-MW Brotman facility, in early 2023. Recently placed in the construction queue, meanwhile, is the 480-MW Remy Jade, a greenfield project.</p>
<p>According to Alvarado, another 1,696 MW is in advanced stages of development. “Overall, we’ve raised close to $1.75 billion—which is fairly unique in the gas and thermal space in the last few years, just in terms of the amount of capital raised and the number of assets funded, under construction, and coming to commercial operation,” Alvarado said.</p>
<h2>Sustainability Is Paramount</h2>
<p>Committed to accelerating a reduced carbon energy future, WattBridge is also developing utility-scale energy storage at several of the company’s natural gas plants, said Alvarado. “That’s something we’ve been thoughtful about when we look for locations: reaching a scale and size that that’s meaningful, but also enables energy storage,” he said. “The economics of it are a little bit challenging right now, but it’s very much in our plans.”</p>

<p>At the same time, PROENERGY has invested $12.3 million (and 10,000 hours of engineering) in a “string-test” facility—“a unique, plant-level facility that mirrors real-world operating conditions while free from the grid”—that became fully hydrogen-ready in February 2022. The facility, equipped with a 60-MW load bank system, serves as the PROENERGY “proving ground” to help expand LM6000PC and PD fuel flexibility and resilience.</p>
<p>The company’s ultimate goal is to test aeroderivative package design enhancements and power-augmentation methods while assessing the limits of hydrogen fuel mixes. <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/proenergy-string-test-facility-expanding-aeroderivative-plant-resilience-with-hydrogen-fuel-tests-coming-in-2022-301472717.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tests, which begin in 2022,</a> will start below “the established 30% hydrogen mix.” The company plans to make incremental increases to a 50% mix, with a long-term goal of a 100% hydrogen burn.</p>
<p>Canon is hopeful tests will initiate the next evolution of the LM6000 platform. “By testing these engines with blended and, eventually, green hydrogen fuel, we will broaden the applications of this technology and strengthen its value within a low-carbon economy,” he said.</p>
