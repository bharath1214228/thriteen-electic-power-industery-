										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>OXNARD, CA (Oct. 19, 2022) — </strong>Given the volatile and unpredictable scale of recent storms, SimpliPhi Power – now part of Briggs and Stratton – is providing reduced pricing on wall-mountable <a href="https://simpliphipower.com/product/phi-3-8-m-battery/"><strong>PHI 3.8 kWh Battery</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href="https://simpliphipower.com/product/big-genny-emergency-power-kit/"><strong>Big Genny Emergency Power Kit</strong></a><strong>, and </strong><a href="https://simpliphipower.com/product/little-genny-emergency-power-kit/"><strong>Little Genny Power Kit</strong></a> through October 31, 2022.</p>
<p>Customer-sited battery storage is a critical solution that creates reliable backup power in the face of growing threats to the centralized grid, whether at home, at work, or on-the-go during evacuations. That is why SimpliPhi is committed to <strong>Energizing America,</strong> a campaign designed to raise awareness and offer discounts to prepare and equip home and business owners with critical battery backup as extreme weather continues to cause widespread power outages across the U.S., putting people, businesses, and communities at risk. The urgency and sheer numbers of people across the country facing power outages inspired <a href="https://simpliphipower.com/">SimpliPhi</a> to create the campaign and offer additional coverage to the entire U.S. and territories.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, Hurricane Fiona battered Puerto Rico, which left 13 dead and hundreds of thousands without clean water or power. <a href="https://simpliphipower.com/deployments/humanitarian/disaster-relief/newfound-hope-for-disaster-stricken-village/">The storm hit on the fifth anniversary of Hurricane Maria</a>, which claimed the lives of 3,000 and caused massive infrastructure damage and power outages. Two weeks after Fiona, over 100,000 Puerto Rican residents are still without access to grid power.</p>
<p>Ten days after Fiona, Hurricane Ian slammed into the west coast of Florida as a Category 4 storm, significantly damaging coastal communities and inundating the mainland, wiping out utility power lines. It then traveled across the state and back into the ocean, hitting South Carolina and parts of Georgia as a Category 1 hurricane. As it traveled, the storm continued to bring heavy rain and severe winds to North Carolina and Virginia. Collectively, 3.4 million people lost access to grid power – with 2.7 million customer outages in Florida alone.</p>
<p>It’s clear that Americans need distributed customer-sited energy storage in their homes and businesses in order to have critical backup power when centralized utility-scale generation, transmission and distribution fails. As Catherine Von Burg, CEO of SimpliPhi Power, observes“Utilities are failing to deliver on their promise to provide reliable and affordable access to power. Centralized generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure is antiquated and inadequate, failing to meet the escalating demand on the grid with electrification and EV charging, even in the best of times – pre-hurricane season.”</p>
<p>Distributed, customer-sited energy storage creates resilient homes, businesses, and communities. SimpliPhi has proven energy storage solutions that are safe, reliable, and cost-effective. The company has been deploying energy storage and management systems globally since its founding in 2010. With a proven track record of performance for over a decade, the company has solved problems around resilience and access to energy in some of the harshest environments and most challenging use cases globally, spanning territories in over 45 countries.</p>
<p><a href="https://simpliphipower.com/product-line/">SimpliPhi’s products</a> provide a safer alternative to typical cobalt-based lithium-ion batteries that are prone to thermal runaway and fires. The company only uses lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chemistry, which does not contain cobalt or pose a risk to customers needing emergency backup power.</p>
<p>Have an existing generator? SimpliPhi battery systems can even optimize generators, reducing run-times and fuel costs, creating additional security and savings during prolonged outages when fuel is often scarce.</p>
<p>Together with the backing of the nation’s most trusted energy solutions providers, <a href="https://www.briggsandstratton.com/na/en_us/products/energy/integrated-systems/simpliphi-ess.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Briggs and Stratton</a> – SimpliPhi Power is committed to providing all of the necessary resources to Energize America.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>RICHMOND, Calif., Oct. 12, 2022 —</strong> SunPower Corp. (NASDAQ:SPWR), a leading residential solar technology and energy services provider, and General Motors (NYSE: GM) today announced a collaboration to develop a new home energy system that will enable GM electric vehicles to provide backup energy to a home when properly equipped. GM also named SunPower as a preferred EV charger installation provider and its exclusive solar provider. The collaboration will bring together SunPower&#8217;s home energy expertise and installation capabilities with GM&#8217;s leadership in EV and battery technology to help provide customers with more resilient, <span class="GramE">sustainable</span> and cost-effective energy.</p>
<p>The home energy system and installation services are <a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3674397-1&amp;h=3733205389&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.gm.com%2Fnewsroom.detail.html%2FPages%2Fnews%2Fus%2Fen%2F2022%2Foct%2F1011-energyecosystem.html&amp;a=slated+to+be+available">slated to be available</a> alongside the retail launch of the 2024 Chevrolet Silverado EV, expected Fall 2023. With bi-directional charging capabilities, the Silverado EV paired with a home energy system is expected to provide enough electricity to provide whole home backup1 during a grid outage.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are proud to work alongside GM, a stalwart in American innovation, to seamlessly connect home energy and electric vehicles. This is a vital next step toward making an all-electric lifestyle easy and even more beneficial,&#8221; said Peter <span class="SpellE">Faricy</span>, SunPower CEO. &#8220;Through this collaboration, we are making it easy for EV drivers to power their vehicles with clean energy and providing new ways to offer energy resiliency and peace-of-mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once available, Chevrolet Silverado EV customers will be able to have their home energy system installed at the same time as their Silverado EV charger to enable vehicle-to-home (V2H) power or choose to do so <span class="GramE">at a later date</span>. For interested customers, SunPower and GM will assess the home&#8217;s electrical system for compatibility with bi-directional charging. Customers can also choose to purchase a SunPower® solar system for their home.</p>
<p>An EV customer with solar can charge their vehicle with energy generated from their rooftop system, which is cleaner and often less expensive than charging from the grid. Customers with a home energy system, compatible EV and properly equipped home are also expected to be able to store solar-generated electricity in their vehicle&#8217;s battery and export it directly into their home during the hours when electricity costs the most. This provides an opportunity for them to save even more money on electricity bills depending on home size, energy usage and utility rates.</p>
<p>&#8220;The collaboration with SunPower is a shining example of how GM is working with industry leaders to accelerate our all-electric future and unlock greater value potential for GM Energy customers,&#8221; said Travis Hester, vice president of GM&#8217;s EV Growth Operations. &#8220;Leveraging the combined expertise of our two companies, we are working collaboratively to develop great products, services and solutions, and to provide customers with the tools to help access and manage their home energy applications.&#8221;</p>

The project, commissioned in a ceremony on Oct. 6, is a 24-MW/48-MWh that includes equipment from the Wärtsilä technology group.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The GIGA Buffalo battery installation is at the Wageningen University &amp; Research test center in Lelystad. Officials in an Oct. 7 news release said it provides Eneco, considered the leading energy provider in the Netherlands, with power capacity to help alleviate intermittency from renewable energy resources. The ESS also is expected to help regulate energy frequency and support grid reliability.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Officials at the commissioning event also noted the project will bring revenue through optimization of the renewable assets, while also providing electricity that can be dispatched during periods of peak demand.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re pleased to see this landmark project complete construction and come online. Battery storage is critical for the stabilization of the country’s electric grid and imperative for reaching our clean energy goals,” said Ruud Nijs, the CEO of GIGA Storage BV. Niis was joined at the commissioning event by Rob Jetten, minister for Climate and Energy in the Netherlands.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The ESS features Wärtsilä’s Gridsolv Quantum and GEMS Digital Energy Platform. The GridSolv Quantum is a fully integrated, modular and compact ESS. The company’s smart energy management system, the GEMS Digital Energy Platform, uses machine learning and historic and real-time data analytics to optimize the complete system. The installation also is optimized with Wärtsilä’s Service+ GAP solution, which provides system maintenance with performance guarantees. The equipment was discussed in detail during an Oct. 5 presentation at <em>POWER’s</em> Distributed Energy Conference, held this week at the Gaylord Rockies resort near Denver, Colorado.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“We celebrate another successful energy storage deployment globally, and our first here in the Netherlands. Congratulations to the Netherlands on this victory in their transition toward a net-zero future,” said Jens Norrgård, Director, Europe, for Wärtsilä Energy.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Dutch government officials have a goal to reduce current greenhouse gas emissions by nearly half by 2030, with a target of a 95% reduction by 2050 in order to meet decarbonization goals. Energy analysts have said the Netherlands will need at least 29 GW, and perhaps as much as 54 GW, of energy storage capacity by 2050 to support more renewable energy generation capacity.</p>
<p>“The Buffalo battery will help stabilize the Netherlands’ electricity grid and save a maximum of 23,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year,” said Maarten Quist, COO of GIGA Storage BV, when the project was announced last year. “We’re pleased to work with Wärtsilä to implement this landmark project, which will help us reach our goal of deploying 1.5 GW of energy storage in Europe by 2025.”</p>

This expansion has led to major economic impacts across the country, including widespread job growth. The number of American jobs primarily devoted to solar energy has more than doubled over the past 10 years, according to the annual <a href="https://irecusa.org/resources/national-solar-jobs-census-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>National Solar Jobs Census</i> </a>we publish at the <a href="https://irecusa.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC)</a>.</p>
<p>A few key numbers help tell the story. In 2010, the solar industry added 850 MWdc in capacity and accounted for 93,500 jobs. In 2021, the most recent year for which we have data, the industry added 24 GWdc in capacity and was responsible for 255,000 solar jobs. Most of this job growth has been at solar installation firms, where employment increased nearly 300% since 2010.</p>
<p>Today, solar energy employs more than twice as many people as the coal industry. Meanwhile, we’ve also seen job growth in other renewable energy industries and related sectors such as energy efficiency. A <a href="https://www.energy.gov/policy/us-energy-employment-jobs-report-useer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Department of Energy report</a> found that jobs aligned with carbon “net-zero” industries now represent about 40% of all energy jobs.</p>
<p>Will this job growth continue? In the long run, we can expect it will. Strong consumer demand and rapidly declining costs are fueling continued market growth for solar energy. To meet ambitious climate change goals, it will be essential that we expand clean energy use even faster. The <a href="https://www.seia.org/research-resources/30-2030-new-target-solar-decade" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) has estimated</a> that bringing solar energy to 30% of our energy use by 2030 would lead to over a million jobs.</p>
<p>In recent years, however, net solar job gains have flattened. This is partially a result of increasing labor productivity, as well as a larger proportion of utility-scale projects, which require fewer workers per kilowatt than residential and commercial solar (due to greater economies of scale and less need for custom designs). Policy hurdles have also put constraints on growth, including the failure (until now) to pass comprehensive energy and climate legislation at the federal level.</p>
<p>The good news is that Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act this summer, the most sweeping energy and climate law in U.S. history. The new law is expected to accelerate the use of solar and other clean energy sources, creating new jobs while significantly reducing carbon emissions. This is a cause for celebration, but it bears keeping in mind that our work is not done. Renewable energy will need to expand with unprecedented speed in order to meet our climate goals in the next decade, and strong policies are essential to making this a reality.</p>
<p>So where do we go from here? Bringing solar energy to its full job creation potential will require sustained action among policymakers, industry, educational providers, and local communities. In brief, what follows are some of the key additional actions that will be needed.</p>
<p><b>Interconnection Reform.</b>An often-overlooked issue with an enormous impact on solar energy growth has been the bottlenecks that delay new projects from connecting to the electric grid. This challenge affects both interconnection to the transmission system (such as for utility-scale solar projects) and to the distribution system (such as for rooftop or community solar). In Minnesota, <a href="https://irecusa.org/blog/irec-news/mn-interconnection-ruling-contains-some-wins-and-a-major-threat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an industry analysis</a> estimated it would take 260 years to clear the backlog for interconnection applications at Xcel Energy, until regulators moved to speed up the process. Working with regulators to implement smart interconnection solutions will be a key piece of the puzzle.</p>
<p><b>Workforce Development Solutions.</b> In the midst of the rapid growth of solar installations, the solar industry is facing a hiring challenge. The <i>Solar Jobs Census</i> found that 89% of solar firms reported difficulty finding qualified workers. Developing a pipeline of highly qualified and diverse job candidates will be essential for the industry’s long-term growth.</p>
<p>To address this issue, IREC has worked with the <a href="https://www.ncwe.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Council for Workforce Education</a> to launch the <a href="https://irecusa.org/programs/the-national-clean-energy-workforce-alliance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Clean Energy Workforce Alliance</a>, which includes more than 450 organizations including solar employers, government, and community-based organizations. This collaborative group has come together in a series of convenings to identify and propose solutions to workforce development challenges. The first year of these efforts will culminate in a <a href="https://irecusa.swoogo.com/irecvisionsummit/2214486" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vision Summit</a> in October and the publication of key outcomes in late 2022.</p>
<p><b>State and Local Clean Energy Initiatives.</b> In addition to federal policy, state actions (such as renewable portfolio standards and net metering incentives) will continue to be important. Moreover, solar energy projects can benefit local communities by increasing their tax base and providing low-cost sources of energy for municipal buildings, as well as creating local jobs. <a href="https://irecusa.org/our-work/local-clean-energy-solutions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Initiatives</a> to streamline planning and zoning, permitting requirements, and other local processes can have a significant impact.</p>
<p>There is every reason to be excited to see more solar panels go up over the coming decade, potentially creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs. The growth of related industries like battery storage, electric vehicles, and smart grid technologies will add to this job growth and help build a clean energy economy for the 21st century.</p>

But that’s about to change.</p>
<p>While it’s difficult to estimate future sales, an <a href="https://cdn.ihsmarkit.com/www/pdf/0421/675485260-0421-CU-AUT-ZEV-Whitepaper.pdf">analysis by IHS Markit</a> projects that up to 30% of new car sales could be electric by 2030, rising to up to 45% by 2035. Using those projected growth rates, Reuters estimates that by 2050 <a href="https://graphics.reuters.com/AUTOS-ELECTRIC/USA/mopanyqxwva/">more than half of the vehicles on U.S. roads could be EVs</a>.

<p style="padding: 2px 6px 4px; color: #555555; background-color: #eeeeee; border: 2px solid #dddddd; text-align: center;"><strong>COMMENTARY</strong></p>
<p>On top of that, the recently enacted <a href="https://www.powermag.com/biden-signs-bill-to-transform-u-s-energy-combat-climate-change/">Inflation Reduction Act</a> and <a href="https://www.powermag.com/blog/direct-pay-proposals-in-the-build-back-better-act-and-observations-from-industry-insiders/">Build Back Better Act</a> are putting significant funds and momentum into the electrification of U.S. transportation. This is likely to accelerate EV adoption and, on a broader level, accelerate the energy transition from fossil fuels to electricity.</p>
<p>Yet despite this momentum and considerable investment, questions remain. <a href="https://www.powermag.com/driving-change-on-the-grid-the-impact-of-ev-adoption/">Can the power grid handle it</a> when more of what we do “plugs in?”</p>
<p>The short answer is yes &#8230; if we act now. In fact, <a href="https://www.powermag.com/the-power-interview-evs-lead-charge-for-electrification/">EVs can lead to even greater consumer benefits</a>. If managed strategically, they can be the “driver” behind making our grid more robust and resilient because of increased investment and strategic collaboration.</p>
<h2>The 21<sup>st</sup> Century Grid</h2>
<p>When people think of the power grid, they tend to think of generation (power plants and renewables, such as solar and wind) and large, overhead transmission lines. Beyond that, the distribution system is the final stage of the electrical grid that takes power into homes, businesses, and other end users, such as public EV charging stations. It delivers electric power to every user on the grid and steps down the power to safe customer-usable levels.</p>
<p>Until now, most of the attention and investment has been focused on generation and transmission, but distribution should never be decoupled from these two.</p>
<p style="padding: 2px 6px 4px; color: #555555; background-color: #eeeeee; border: 2px solid #dddddd; text-align: center;"><strong>Electric vehicles and their impact on the power grid will be discussed at POWER’s <a href="https://www.distributedenergyconference.com/">Distributed Energy Conference</a>, Oct. 3-6 at the Gaylord Rockies resort near Denver, Colorado. There’s still time to register for the event!</strong></p>
<p>The 21<sup>st</sup> century grid needs more investment in distribution to deliver power safely and efficiently to end users as more charge their vehicles. Distribution systems in residential neighborhoods with particularly high plug-in EV adoption may see substantial load increases, adding more stress to the system.</p>
<p>Focused efforts to strengthen the reliability and resilience of the distribution system are essential to keep temporary faults from affecting the grid. The moment the distribution system goes down, EV charging stops. And as more EVs come onto the grid, the higher the stakes become for the grid to effectively minimize the impact from any disturbance or temporary faults.</p>
<p>The key to preparing for the energy transition and a future of electrification is to think holistically about the entirety of the grid—and to take a systemwide approach to grid investments. This helps manage key pressure points as well as build a foundation for a broader charging network.</p>
<p>The U.S. electrical grid has an influx of new funding, but can it be updated fast enough to support the growing number of EVs on roads? We believe so.</p>
<h2>Collaboration</h2>
<p>Utilities are at the epicenter of the energy transition. They play an essential role in eliminating as much as 75% of the energy sector’s carbon emissions through decarbonization of the electric power sector and full or partial electrification of transportation, residential and commercial buildings, and small manufacturing.</p>
<p>Utilities operate in a complex environment, where they must support the goals of regulators, minimize rate hikes for consumers, and comply with federal and state policies. Creating alignment with all industry stakeholders and local governments about the vision for the energy transition is the only way forward.</p>
<p>To succeed and make sure the grid is ready, we must continue to build an ecosystem of partners willing to collaborate on a shared vision for the future grid. This work to advance the grid must happen quickly, and it requires commitment and contribution from every stakeholder.</p>
<p>Grid transformation and modernization is vital to electrification, <a href="https://www.powermag.com/the-billion-dollar-bet-on-electric-vehicles/">but it requires investment</a>, such as the $73 billion for electric grids designated by the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Meanwhile, many utilities are moving forward with modernization efforts. These utilities are prioritizing infrastructure upgrades and collaborating strategically to ensure they meet growing demand and achieve decarbonization goals.</p>
<p>EVs might garner the most attention, but for the energy transition, the grid is the real key to advancement.</p>

<p>Increasing the grid interactivity of facilities is becoming a key enabler for decarbonization as more renewables are onboarded, stemming from the grid, on-site generation, and as uptake of electric vehicles becomes more widespread. Verdantix recommends that customers required to adapt to a rapidly changing energy landscape and looking to implement on-site renewable generation and storage as part of wider corporate decarbonization goals, should consider Schneider Electric’s microgrid offerings.</p>
<p>“Schneider Electric offers a comprehensive suite of hardware, software and services for energy management and automation in infrastructure to enable sustainable, reliable and efficient operations,” said Verdantix Analyst Ben Hext. “We think that they are well positioned to provide microgrid offerings that meet a variety of needs, including resilience, on-site renewable energy and energy savings.”</p>
<p>“Microgrids are a key enabler in the pursuit of a decarbonized environment and a more sustainable energy future, which is why Schneider Electric has built one of the best microgrid portfolios in the market,” said <em>Bala</em> <em>Vinayagam</em>, SVP, Microgrid Line of Business at Schneider Electric. “Rising energy prices, the increasing frequency of grid outages, and the requirement to decarbonize have made energy challenges relevant and universal to all. As one of the most reputable global sustainability companies, Schneider has made it so that the benefits of microgrids can transform the energy profiles of a diverse set of infrastructure.”</p>
<p>Schneider Electric helps its customers succeed with its microgrids offerings:</p>
<ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet">
<li><strong>Flexible energy consumption to reduce power costs:</strong> Firms must mitigate exposure to fluctuating energy prices by exploring on-site generation and storage. For example, Citycon, a real estate owner and developer, is developing a microgrid-enabled city center in Espoo, Finland in partnership with Schneider Electric. Schneider Electric and Citycon project the program will save $352,000 in energy costs per year with an ROI of 5 years in conjunction with investment aid for new technologies.</li>
<li><strong>Increased resilience against grid failures:</strong> EcoStruxure Microgrid Advisor uses predictive analytics to carefully balance electricity consumption and generation for resilience. The platform can ingest historical data, weather forecasts, energy market pricing and scheduled operations to optimize energy flows in case of grid outages. For example, the US Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego installed a microgrid from Schneider Electric to ensure continued power access during sustained grid outages of up to 14 days.</li>
<li><strong>On-site renewable generation and storage for corporate decarbonization goals:</strong> Many businesses are pursuing net zero goals to align with governmental targets, such as the Paris Agreement. Lidl Finland installed a microgrid from Schneider Electric at a 60,000m2 distribution center. Projections estimate that the facility will reduce energy consumption by 50% and enable 100% renewable energy consumption through on-site generation and clean energy purchase agreements.</li>
<li><strong>Smarter use of renewable energy and EV charging to decarbonize operations: </strong>Governments worldwide are introducing a shift from fossil fuel vehicles toward EVs. Montgomery County is deploying a microgrid for EV charging at the Brookville Smart Energy Bus Depot through an EaaS agreement with Schneider Electric’s AlphaStruxure. The microgrid integration will deliver reliable charging to a fleet of 44 electric buses, cutting carbon emissions by 62% and enabling the county to maintain bus services during power outages.</li>

<h2 class="p4"><span class="s3">A Closer Look at the Pathways</span></h2>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The roadmap spearheads a “cross-cutting” approach that leverages technologies, processes, and practices. The DOE’s chosen pathways—specific actions the U.S. can pursue—are based on four “pillars,” which represent &#8220;foundational elements&#8221; of the overall industrial decarbonization strategy. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The DOE said it chose the pillars “amongst a range of options </span>due to their ability to provide step-change reductions, applicability across all industrial subsectors, and the capability to deliver near-term and future reductions as the [greenhouse gas (GHG)] emissions intensity of the electrical grid decreases, technologies develop (e.g., clean hydrogen), and hard-to-abate sources are addressed (by CCUS for example).”</p>
<p class="p5"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><b>Energy Efficiency. </b></span>Using energy more efficiently in the industrial sector may be a key cost-effective option, given the sector’s generation and use of heat, including for process heating, boilers, and combined heat and power (CHP) systems. In U.S. manufacturing, steam accounts for 30% of process heat energy use, the DOE noted on Wednesday. However, the proportion of energy used for process heating varies by industry across broad ranges. Lower temperature ranges (below 150C) offer &#8220;the most significant energy reduction opportunities&#8221; for current and emerging technologies, the agency said. The agency also pointed to efficiency measures related to electrical energy consumption. Motor applications including pumps, fans, compressed air, materials handling, and others account for 91% of manufacturing electrical energy consumption, it said.</p>
<p class="p5">Energy efficiency efforts in the sector could come from investments in technology developments, for example, for energy-efficient process heating (even if it relies on fossil fuel combustion), until the grid can sustainably support electrification. Digitalization, including smart manufacturing and advanced data analytics, could also help unlock energy efficiency, the agency suggested.</p>
<p class="p5">The DOE also prominently highlighted the potential of CHP technology, particularly if switched over to emerging low-carbon fuels in the future, to tamp down energy losses. “Industrial CHP systems, through both topping and bottoming cycles, can provide needed energy services for some subsectors with overall energy efficiencies of 65%–85% compared to separate production of heat and power, which collectively averages 45%–55% system efficiency,” it says. “In particular, CHP is prevalent in chemicals, pulp and paper, refining, primary metals, and food industries, but can also be found in crop production, nonmetallic minerals, and other uses.”</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Industrial Electrification and Low Carbon Fuels, Feedstocks, and Energy Sources.</span> </b>Emerging technologies could provide notable opportunities to help the industrial sector make cost-competitive step-change reductions in GHG emissions, particularly in applications associated with process heat, the DOE said.</span></p>
<p class="p5">Low-carbon fuels and energy sources include the use of renewable energy sources, nuclear energy (from fission and/or future fusion reactors), concentrated solar power,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and geothermal. Low-carbon feedstocks include bio-based and end-of-life materials, the agency said.</p>
<p class="p5">Using hydrogen may also be an option. While <a href="https://www.powermag.com/hydrogen-poised-to-play-prominent-role-in-the-worlds-energy-transition/">most hydrogen</a> is currently made from reforming of natural gas, hydrogen production from renewables,<a href="https://www.powermag.com/hydrogen-may-be-a-lifeline-for-nuclear-but-it-wont-be-easy/"> nuclear power</a>, or fossil resources with carbon capture can reduce GHG emissions from these existing demand sectors. Hydrogen production using electrolyzers can additionally supply grid services to increase grid resiliency, and hydrogen technologies can also be used <a href="https://www.powermag.com/aces-deltas-giant-utah-salt-cavern-hydrogen-storage-project-gets-504m-conditional-doe-loan-guarantee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for long-duration energy storage</a>.</p>
<p class="p5">The electrification of process heat may also be especially important, it noted. In the U.S., process heating consumes more energy than any other manufacturing end-use. “In 2018, a total of 7,576 trillion Btu (TBtu) of fuel, steam, and electric energy were consumed by U.S. manufacturers for this purpose, comprising 51% of total onsite manufacturing energy. In the same year, process heating accounted for 360 million metric tons of CO<span class="s4">2</span>e GHG emissions, representing 31% of the manufacturing sector’s total energy-related emissions,&#8221; the roadmap says.</p>
<p class="p5">Temperature ranges in individual sectors will prove important to this effort, given that about 30% of process heat demand is at temperatures at or below 150C. “Electric technologies like heat pumps, microwave technologies, infrared technologies and other low- and no-carbon sources of process heat such as solar thermal and nuclear could be considered for use in this range,” the DOE said. However, nuclear can go up to 300C, and advanced gas-cooled very-high-temperature reactors can reach 900C at scales that suit distributed applications, it said. Getting these technologies deployed, however, will require RD&amp;D.</p>
<p class="p5"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><b>Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage. </b></span>The DOE views CCUS as a mitigation strategy for industrial decarbonization. However, CCUS faces constraints. While CCUS has been demonstrated across various sectors, broad-scale deployment of CCUS faces regulatory and economic challenges.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The industrial sector faces “high costs for industrial plants in terms of both capital and operating costs,” it said.</p>
<p class="p5">CCUS could benefit from more research on better catalysts and process designs to bring higher efficiency levels, lower costs, and lower material consumption or waste production, the roadmap notes. A future national-level CCUS network may also be integral, though more work is needed on pairing and optimizing carbon capture technologies with industrial processes based on CO<sub><span class="s4">2 </span></sub>purity and operational considerations of the industrial process.</p>

<h2 class="p4"><span class="s3">How Could Industrial Decarbonization Affect the Power Sector? </span></h2>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The DOE’s roadmap is a significant step in a series of recent efforts to encourage industrial decarbonization. In June 2022, DOE established <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/amo/articles/funding-opportunity-announcement-clean-energy-manufacturing-innovation-institute">a new $70 million funding opportunity </a>as part of its 2016–established <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/amo/clean-energy-smart-manufacturing-innovation-institute-cesmii">Clean Energy Manufacturing Innovation Institute</a> to develop and scale electrified processes </span><span class="s5">that reduce emissions, improve flexibility, and enhance energy efficiency of industrial process heating. And in April, the DOE launched the </span><span class="s6"><a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/amo/industrial-technology-innovation-advisory-committee">Industrial </a></span><span class="s7"><a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/amo/industrial-technology-innovation-advisory-committee">Technology Innovation Advisory Committee</a></span><span class="s3">, a federal advisory committee charged with advising DOE on industrial emissions reductions </span>technologies.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, key DOE officials noted the initiative goes hand-in-hand with the administration&#8217;s larger decarbonization goals, including to achieve <a href="https://www.powermag.com/how-bidens-presidency-could-further-transform-the-power-sector/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">100% clean electricity or a net-zero power grid in the U.S. by 2035.</a></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s3">One reason the Biden administration is focused on the industrial sector is that it is considered a “difficult-to-decarbonize” segment of the energy economy, owing to a diversity of energy inputs that feed into its array of industrial processes and operations. </span><span class="s1">The U.S. industrial sector </span><span class="s8">in 2021 consumed nearly a third of the nation’s primary energy and produced 30% of its energy-related carbon emissions, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). </span></p>
<p class="p12"><span class="s3">The EIA estimates that only 9% of energy consumed by industry came from renewables, while 13% came from electricity retail sales. Industrial consumption, meanwhile, accounted for nearly a quarter of all electricity retail sales. </span></p>

Source: <span class="s3"><a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/us-energy-facts/images/consumption-by-source-and-sector.pdf"><span class="s8">EIA</span></a></span></em></figcaption></figure>
<p class="p13"><span class="s8">The DOE’s roadmap says the bulk of industrial emissions are attributable to combusted fuel and electricity generation, but also to industrial process emissions, and product lifecycle emissions. The chemicals, refining, iron and steel, mining, and agriculture sectors are by far the largest emitters of industrial emissions. </span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="s8">Decarbonizing the manufacturing sector won’t be easy, it acknowledges. “</span>To decarbonize the industrial sector, the United States will face a range of structural and technical challenges. Considering the sheer magnitude of materials transformations undertaken in industry, from extraction of raw materials to the creation of intermediate and final products, decarbonization will require a wide range of technology solutions that will have a ripple effect across increasingly complex supply chains,&#8221; it noted.</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="s3">How it will affect the power sector, which is in the midst of its own transformation, remains debated. Most industry observers note, however, that if industrial decarbonization leans heavily on electrification, electricity demand could jump substantially. An Aug 30</span><span class="s9">–released</span><span class="s3"> report from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) that examines <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy22osti/81644.pdf"><span class="s8">supply-side options to achieve 100% clean electricity by 2035</span></a> suggests aggressive electrification of end uses—for all sectors, including transportation, residential, commercial, and industrial—could nearly double demand by 2035. Without a boost in energy efficiency, the study projects annual direct electricity consumption in 2035 could soar to 6,200 TWh, compared with 3,700 TWh in 2020. </span></p>
<p class="p12"><span class="s3">The report, however, warns that dramatically accelerating the electrification of demand sectors to get the county on the path to net-zero by 2050 could make it “more difficult to decarbonize the electricity system due to the rate of deployment needed.” Still, electrification of buildings, much of transportation, and industry presents “the most cost-effective pathway” to achieving large-scale decarbonization across the economy. “</span><span class="s10">Aggressive energy efficiency and demand management measures can help reduce deployment needs,” NREL noted. </span></p>

<p><em><strong>A terminal at San Francisco International Airport (SFO) is the world’s first to receive a new and important design recognition from a green building group. Harvey Milk Terminal 1 at SFO is being recognized for its commitment to sustainability and renewable energy.</strong></em></p>
<p>Airport terminals may not be top of mind when it comes to energy innovation. Those involved with upgrades to a terminal at San Francisco International Airport (SFO) would beg to differ.</p>
<p>Harvey Milk Terminal 1 at SFO, named for one of the first openly gay men elected to public office in the U.S., earlier this year became the first airport terminal in the world to earn a “Platinum” certification using the latest standards from the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program developed by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC). The agency’s latest version of the standards, known as LEED v4, considers the design, construction, and operation of what it calls high-performance structures.</p>
<p>A number of factors secured the designation for Harvey Milk Terminal 1, many involved with the site’s energy efficiency and sustainability, including its power generation from a rooftop solar array. The terminal upgrade project, which includes increasing the number of gates in Terminal 1, has an estimated price tag of $2.4 billion. Work on the terminal, which replaced an existing 10-gate facility, began in 2016.</p>
<p>The project weathered numerous pandemic-related delays, and was helped this year by money from the federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Officials said the airport will receive a total of about $250 million in funds from the infrastructure bill over the next five years, which also will go toward an upgrade of the airport’s electrical power distribution infrastructure.</p>
<p>The Terminal 1 project includes adding more gates in a multi-level building that includes an art gallery, food halls, concessions, an automated baggage handling system, connections to ground transportation, and new post-security connections to the international terminal, enabling the upgraded facility to handle both domestic and international flights. The project’s commitment to renewable energy, and energy efficiency in its design and operation, has earned it a Top Plant award from <em>POWER</em>.</p>
<p>“Harvey Milk Terminal 1 sets a new benchmark for the airport experience, and serves as a tribute to the life and legacy of a pioneering civil rights leader,” said Ivar C. Satero, the airport’s director. “For millions of people around the world, SFO is the first impression of the San Francisco Bay Area, and Harvey Milk Terminal 1 showcases what makes our region great: a spirit of innovation, a focus on the environment, and most importantly, a commitment to diversity, equality, and inclusion.”</p>
<h2>Electrical Upgrades</h2>
<p>Teams from Cupertino Electric Inc. (CEI) worked on the Terminal 1 project over the course of three phases. CEI said its public infrastructure, solar, and low-voltage teams installed electrical systems, LED lighting, and the complete fire alarm system. CEI said the “updated terminal features a 12-kV distribution with three double-ended substations, six 400-kW distribution power systems for aircraft power, two emergency back-up generators [a 1,250 kW and a 500 kW], seven uninterrupted power supplies, 29 Advance Visual Docking Guidance System units for aircraft docking, and a Ground Service Equipment charging system.” The company’s Renewables Team also worked on the 1.3-MW rooftop solar array that consists of nearly 3,000 photovoltaic panels.</p>

<p>The rooftop solar (Figure 1) came with some design challenges. Officials said the azimuth, or angle, of the array was analyzed in relation to the airport’s runways, so that approaching airplanes would not be impacted by glare when landing or taking off. An engineering firm that specializes in glare studies ensured a safe layout for the solar panels. Two contractors, Hensel Phelps and Redwood Electric, found a racking system—Sollega’s FastRack FR510—that could follow the curvature design and handle the roof’s undulations. The system is slightly angled, which makes it appear to be curved when seen from far above.</p>
<p>Sollega said the radius design of the array “demonstrates the flexibility of the FR510’s capabilities,” and said the system “will generate over 2.2 MWh a year of electricity.”</p>
<p>“It’s a high-profile project. It was a LEED certification building, and being involved in a LEED project is exciting,” said Elie Rothschild, sales manager for Sollega. “We’re a San Francisco-based company, so it’s great to be involved at the airport.”</p>
<p>Rothschild told <em>POWER</em>: “It was a challenging roof, because it’s a C-shaped building. We had to adapt the arrays to suit the roof. There are pretty significant undulations on the roof, and our racking handles undulations pretty well. We’ve done a few airports now, so we’ve gotten experience with that.” Rothschild said Sollega already is preparing to work on the next phase of the Terminal 1 expansion project. The company a few years ago installed rooftop solar systems at the Honolulu International and Kahului airports in Hawaii.</p>
<h2>Energy-Efficient Systems</h2>
<p>Harvey Milk 1 features a tote-based Independent Carrier System, or ICS, to manage checked baggage. It’s the first such system in the U.S.; officials said it uses 50% less energy, and is easier to operate and maintain, than previous baggage systems. The terminal also uses “self-energizing,” or regenerative, elevators that recycle energy, rather than discarding it as heat. The site’s “Go-Slow” escalators and moving walkways reduce their speed when not in use, another energy-saving feature.</p>
<p>Radiant heating and cooling complement the terminal’s displacement ventilation, another energy-efficient feature that also improves the indoor air quality. Controllable, dimmable, long-life LED fixtures throughout the facility also save energy. Other features of the project include:</p>
<ul>■ Dynamic glazed windows that change with the sun’s location to reduce glare and improve comfort.</ul>
<ul>■ Large windows harnessing daylight to reduce the need for electric lighting.</ul>
<ul>■ Low-flow, hands-free bathroom fixtures and faucets save water in drought-prone California.</ul>
<ul>■ Highly efficient outdoor air filtration system to remove pollutants and odor to provide healthier indoor environments with minimal efficiency impacts.</ul>
<ul>■ Building materials and furnishings with low-volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions.</ul>
<ul>■ Selection of products, systems, and materials with the least environmental impact.</ul>
<ul>■ An integrated building management system measures energy and water use and adjusts equipment to be more efficient.</ul>
<ul>■ Seamless access to all facilities, including public transit, via the AirTrain electric people mover, which eliminated more than 600,000 miles of bus trips annually.</ul>
<ul>■ Recycling and diversion of about 95% of construction waste from landfill.</ul>
<p>Installations in the terminal include several educational displays about the life of Milk, who was assassinated after serving 11 months on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1978. Corridors leading to the customs areas include a photo essay about Milk. “I think people in the Bay Area are probably familiar with him, whereas people coming from abroad have maybe never even heard of him,” said Doug Yakel, an SFO spokesperson. “This really helps tell the story to a more international audience.”</p>
<h2>Environmental and Sustainability Focus</h2>
<p>HKS, an airport design firm; Woods Bagot, a global architectural practice; ED2, a technology company; and KYA, a group that creates sustainable built environments, were all part of the project’s design-built team. HKS served as the project lead for programming and exterior envelope architecture, as well as the sustainability lead partnered with Arup.</p>
<p>Arup, a multinational professional services company that provides design, engineering, architecture, planning, and advisory services, “worked with the multidisciplinary design team to make sure everything from structural materials to floor finishes to unique systems met rigorous sustainability criteria,” according to the company. Arup said, “By optimizing the cement content of the structural concrete, we were able to reduce the embodied carbon footprint of the entire building by over 10%.” The company also said, “In a first for the building industry, we are obtaining an environmental product declaration for the passenger boarding bridges—a critical piece of information that allows for the assessment and improvement of the environmental footprint of building components.”</p>
<p>That environmental focus aligns with the airport’s “Sustainability Strategy,” which emphasizes zero waste, carbon neutrality through electrification, and a “zero net energy” campus.</p>
<p>Satero told <em>POWER</em>, “This facility was designed with both our passengers and employees in mind … as a place to be relaxed, a place to be healthy, and a place to be inspired by the legacy of pioneering civil rights leader Harvey Milk. This terminal embodies the very best values of the San Francisco Bay Area, and we are proud that this is the first airport facility ever to be certified under the Fitwel standards.”</p>

They are established as a collaborative initiative coordinated by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in conjunction with the General Services Administration.</p>
<p>The USGBC, meanwhile, said the LEED v4 certification “is designed to up the ante with a more flexible, performance-based approach that calls for measurable results throughout a building’s life cycle.” Said Satero: “We are truly proud to be the first airport in the world to earn LEED v4 Platinum certification. This achievement continues a tradition of leadership in sustainable facilities that includes the first LEED Gold airport terminal in the United States, and the world’s first zero net energy facility at an airport. My thanks go out to the entire project team for continuing to push the envelope for what airports can accomplish to support our environmental goals.”</p>

<p>Again, this year, Experience POWER will be co-located with the Distributed Energy Conference (DEC) and HydrogeNext, giving attendees the opportunity to learn from and network with trailblazers from the power industry, who are leading the way in the world’s energy transition. These <a href="https://www.experience-power.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three events cover the full energy value chain for the power industry</a>, delivering the best content and covering cutting-edge technology that is important to power professionals. The events will be held at the <a href="https://www.experience-power.com/hotel-travel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gaylord Rockies Resort and Convention Center</a> in Aurora, Colorado, Oct. 3–6, 2022.</p>
<h2>Experience POWER in Its 24th Year</h2>
<p>“Our flagship event Experience POWER was created by electricity generators, for electricity generators, and we have continued to grow our content to cover the pressing topics and industry changes as they come,” said Kayla Sparks, group show director for the Energy and Engineering Group with Access Intelligence. “This means our brand and our events have continued to grow, which is why we now also offer the co-located Distributed Energy Conference and HydrogeNext, which provide the opportunity to dive deeper into advancing sectors impacting your plant.”</p>
<p>“The three events provide a broad range of great educational content, from sessions focused on central power stations and grid infrastructure to distributed energy resources and the hydrogen economy,” said <em>POWER</em> Executive Editor Aaron Larson. “I’m particularly interested in hearing what the keynote speakers have to share, and I’m also excited to be moderating an Executive Roundtable session at the event.”</p>
<p>Among the keynote presenters will be Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association President and CEO Duane Highley, and Robert Chapman, senior vice president of Energy Delivery and Customer Solutions, and Chief Sustainability Officer with the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI). Highley is expected to talk about his group’s “Responsible Energy Plan,” which will likely include details on how Tri-State is eliminating emissions at facilities in New Mexico and Colorado, while adding more than 1 GW of wind and solar power to its resource mix. Chapman is expected to cover topics such as natural gas infrastructure, low-carbon fuels, electrification, technology adoption, and much more.</p>
<h2>DEC Connects the Entire Distributed Generation Ecosystem</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.distributedenergyconference.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DEC brings together utility-scale electricity providers with other power generators</a>, including commercial and industrial facilities, educational institutions, cooperatives, and private enterprise to dive into real-life applications, project planning, and the business and financial aspects of distributed generation. On the agenda the first day is a session looking at how electric vehicles (EVs) are literally “driving” distributed power generation, helping decarbonize the transportation sector. Jim Auld of Florida Power &amp; Light, Pam Frank of ChargEVC, and Ann Moore of OSIsoft will participate in that discussion, focusing on how the growth of EVs will impact the future of the power grid.</p>
<p>“Utilities are studying how increased power demand to charge EVs will affect power loads. Consumers are weighing the pros and cons of buying EVs. Commercial building owners, industrial sites, and even residential home builders are recognizing the need to accommodate charging infrastructure as part of their future plans,” said Darrell Proctor, senior associate editor with <em>POWER</em>. “I’ll be there too, offering insights from <em>POWER </em>into how the electrification of transportation is changing the energy landscape.”</p>
<p>“We’ll address key distributed power generation topics such as EV charging impacts on the grid, district energy planning, design, and implementation, going beyond the traditional methods to secure financing for distributed energy projects, and technologies for battery energy storage that have reached the commercial stage, just to name a few,” said Ellen Nyboer, show manager and senior marketing manager for the Energy and Engineering Group with Access Intelligence.</p>
<h2>HydrogeNext: An Event for the Emerging H<sub>2</sub> Economy</h2>
<p>Hydrogen has been at the center of much enthusiastic discussion, due to its potential to help many industrial sectors realize their decarbonization goals and provide a sustainable source of energy. But what does the “hydrogen economy” really mean for power companies, and chemical processors—who are among the world’s largest consumers of hydrogen?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.experience-power.com/hydrogenext/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HydrogeNext is the one event</a> designed to answer that question. It covers the full hydrogen energy value chain from production to distribution and end-use, bringing together power generation and chemical process industry professionals to collaborate and learn about the fast-paced advances being made toward a hydrogen economy.</p>
<p>“In October, industry leaders at the cutting edge of the energy and manufacturing sectors will convene in Denver at the HydrogeNext conference to map out their hydrogen and decarbonization goals through collaborative discussions on hydrogen storage, safety and regulatory considerations, the electrolysis evolution, practical success stories, and much more,” said Mary Page Bailey, senior associate editor with <em>Chemical Engineering</em>. “No matter your plant’s place in the hydrogen value chain, HydrogeNext will provide connections with key technology and business experts to provide insights about the quickly accelerating hydrogen economy.”</p>
<h2>Connect with Leading Companies</h2>
<p>Among the sponsors at the events are AVEVA and Caterpillar. AVEVA, a global leader in industrial software, drives digital transformation for industrial organizations managing complex operational processes. Through Performance Intelligence, AVEVA connects the power of information and artificial intelligence with human insight, to enable faster and more precise decision-making, helping industries to boost operational delivery and sustainability.

<p>So, what do we do to cool down? We crank up the air conditioner. But with each surge in energy demand, our aging grid is being pushed to the brink—and sometimes, it simply can’t keep up.</p>
<p style="padding: 2px 6px 4px; color: #555555; background-color: #eeeeee; border: 2px solid #dddddd; text-align: center;"><strong>COMMENTARY</strong></p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-renewables-electric-grid/">Reuters&#8217; analysis</a> of North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) data, on average, 9,656 outages occurred annually between 2015 and 2020. That is more than double the average during the previous six-year period. Unfortunately, all signs indicate that we can expect more of the same throughout 2022 and beyond. NERC’s <a href="https://www.nerc.com/pa/RAPA/ra/Reliability%20Assessments%20DL/NERC_SRA_2022.pdf">2022 Summer Reliability Assessment</a> found that power outages are likely in parts of the Midwest, California and Texas this summer.</p>
<p>The status quo is not sustainable, and it’s putting people—especially our most vulnerable—at risk. While initiatives such as carbon-neutral goals are essential to preparing for tomorrow, utilities must act now to keep up with today’s reality: summers that keep getting hotter.</p>
<h2>Ensuring Supply Can Keep Up With Demand</h2>
<p>Providing utilities and consumers greater insight and control over energy consumption is a critical component of a modern grid. It helps the grid contend with increased energy demand during the summer months and addresses challenges that arise from changing behavior and demand, onset by electric vehicle (EV) adoption and distributed energy resources (DERs) integration.</p>
<p>This is where distributed intelligence (DI) comes into play.</p>
<p>A DI platform combines smart endpoints (meters, devices and other sensors) with peer-to-peer connectivity. Applications can then be downloaded to devices in the field to solve existing and new challenges. Key benefits from this approach include grid optimization, asset management, integration of DERs, and consumer engagement—all critical to ensuring supply can keep up with demand.</p>
<h2>Engaging the End User to Reduce Peak Energy Demand</h2>
<p>DI technology provides several opportunities when it comes to encouraging end users to make educated decisions about their energy usage. One of the simplest ways is giving consumers access to their consumption data in real time through their meter over Wi-fi. They can then change their daily habits on their own to reduce costs and the chance of an unwanted surprise on their next bill.</p>
<p>A demand response (DR) program takes this one step further. A DR program is a fairly straightforward concept—during a period of high demand, end users reduce their usage and are rewarded with an incentive payment or another form of financial compensation. This is on top of savings realized from using less energy during peak price periods.</p>
<p>While it’s a simple concept, not all DR programs look the same. Direct load control programs, for example, allow utility companies to automatically turn off appliances such as air conditioning for a short time when demand skyrockets. This opt-in program works without the need for manual intervention by the customer.</p>
<p>Other programs require the consumer to take action. Time-of-use (TOU)/peak alerts proactively share real-time data with a consumer. These insights—including approximate savings that could be achieved if the use of the appliances were curtailed during the peak price period—can help consumers make educated decisions about their energy usage when pricing signals are sent.</p>
<h2>Checking All the Boxes to Ensure Success</h2>
<p>A successful DR program must be strategically designed from start to finish. Everything from technology implementations (smart meters, analytics solutions, etc.) must be in place, while billing, compensation and regulatory considerations must be accounted for. Additionally, utility companies must ensure customer engagement efforts are ramped up, from basic energy education to community awareness campaigns and competitions.</p>
<p>There are a lot of moving parts that must be considered when it comes to a DR program. However, when done right, these programs put intelligence gathered from the edge of the grid to good use. It helps utilities manage the equilibrium and cost of energy systems and ensures the continued reliability of electric generation and distribution. It’s the responsibility of utilities to ensure the lights stay on, but customers now also play an essential part in preventing dangerous blackouts and brownouts. The good news is that customers are willing to help—they just need to know how.</p>
