These issues, in addition to geopolitical tensions, are deeply complex and cannot be addressed on an individual scale.</p>
<p>In addition, the energy industry faces major challenges pertaining to communication given that the workforce and equipment operate in remote and harsh environments. With assets and personnel continuously on the move in areas that lack traditional methods of connectivity, it can be difficult to monitor productivity and access field data. This, in turn, can impact other critical events or environmental compliance standards, as well as emergency response safeguards.</p>
<p>While individual businesses cannot strengthen the global supply chain independently, solve the labor shortage, or reconcile international relations, fortunately, the latter set of issues related to connectivity can be ameliorated. Where terrestrial cellular coverage falls short, satellite connectivity prevails. With satellite coverage, continuous connectivity can be ensured for remote asset tracking, asset management, secure communications at exploration sites, monitoring transmission and deliveries tracked by internet of things (IoT) infrastructure, and worker safety for improved business efficiencies.</p>
<p>Given the current strain on the energy industry, it’s imperative to save costs and increase productivity whenever possible. Certain challenges may be uncontrollable, but issues such as visibility, connectivity, and communication can undoubtedly be addressed and doing so will result in significant benefits for business owners, employees, and customers alike.</p>
<h2>Satellite IoT in Action</h2>
<p>Satellite IoT refers to the use of satellite communication networks and services to connect terrestrial IoT sensors and IoT end-nodes to a server. IoT enables interconnectivity between objects such that they can communicate and relay orders without requiring human-to-human or even human-to-computer interaction. The type of information relayed depends upon the specific IoT sensor, which is determined based on the use case.</p>
<p>As a concept, it can be challenging to grasp how revolutionary this technology can be for the energy sector. While continuous, dependable connectivity and asset management sound useful, how exactly is the value realized? There are an infinite number of ways that satellite IoT can be implemented; the limit of its applications is constrained only by the limit of the imagination.</p>
<p>Take cathodic protection (CP), for example. CP systems keep corrosion under control, thus protecting the millions of miles of metallic pipelines that carry petroleum products, natural gas, water, and wastewater throughout our communities. However, to continue to be effective, these systems must eventually be replaced. Traditionally, site inspections by pipeline personnel are required multiple times per year. With thousands of miles of pipelines running through remote territory, a significant amount of time must be devoted to staffing time and travel costs.</p>
<p>However, with satellite IoT, CP systems can be monitored wirelessly for pipeline operators around the world. The satellite IoT device provides continuous performance monitoring with automated alerts to unusual conditions or failure, and the ability to test remotely. Furthermore, technicians can use any web-enabled device to access a cloud platform to see where CP systems are operating normally and to download performance data, generate reports, and remotely modify device configurations.</p>
<p>Another prevalent application for satellite IoT in the energy industry is oil tank monitoring. To maintain oil production, the fluid levels in storage tanks at a drill site require regular monitoring. Legacy measurement systems are complicated, costly to install and calibrate, and often require personnel to check gauges by hand. Tank monitoring is increasingly being handled remotely, but for drilling rigs on the move, cellular connection is unreliable.</p>
<p>Satellite enabled IoT tools can illuminate data on tank levels including GPS coordinates, allowing drilling companies and their vendors to see all tanks, establish automatic alerts when levels are low, and automate dispatch of supply trucks to refill the tanks. Smart data processing on edge devices allows for limited data transmission when tanks require no action and the condensation of data into short messages, therefore reducing transmission costs. Drilling companies can effectively save thousands of unnecessary hours and ensure that fluids are always available to support uninterrupted operation.</p>
<p>These examples are just a sample of the litany of ways in which satellite IoT technology can be leveraged throughout the energy sector.</p>
<h2>Continuous Connectivity Meets Customization</h2>
<p>To truly grasp the dependability of satellite connectivity, it’s important to understand that this technology is relied upon to save thousands of lives each year. For personnel working in remote locations, satellite messengers can be used to share information on location and status in case of an emergency. If thousands are willing to utilize satellite communications when their lives are at stake, every business owner should have peace of mind when it comes to using the same technology to monitor and manage their equipment, fleets, or assets.</p>
<p>In addition to reliability, satellite IoT solutions can be customized to suit specific needs or use cases. Embedded satellite IoT chips can integrate with a wide range of hardware based on application needs. However, the true breadth of customization is realized on the software end of IoT.</p>
<p>With certain devices and enablement platforms, instead of custom-coding for specific device hardware, developers can, utilizing a low-code platform, hardware abstraction, and unified APIs, seamlessly interface between application and capabilities of the satellite IoT edge device. By developing artificial intelligence (AI)-driven applications that send smart data from the edge, energy businesses can effectively reduce the transmission fee associated with sending data from the IoT device to the endpoint, or server, and improve operational performance.</p>
<p>Flexibility is also a useful attribute of satellite IoT solutions. Say, for instance, an organization is looking to expand its IoT capabilities, additional sensors can deliver valuable new capabilities quickly and easily by using Bluetooth connectivity. Furthermore, if a business would benefit from machine learning and executable files to improve the performance of systems in the field, the right IoT partner will have the storage and processing power necessary to run applications at the edge, and the platform to simplify configuration, application development, and device management.</p>
<p>As society continues to advance along with technology, many are looking to renewable energy options in addition to traditional energy sources like oil and gas. These energy production methods are also often located in remote areas and would benefit from satellite IoT as much as any other organization that has people and assets located in isolated areas.</p>
<p>The beauty of satellite IoT is that it will work for you, regardless of your specific needs or geographical location. For those who operate in remote areas that stand to gain from improved visibility, reliability, reduced cost, and repurposed employee hours, consider satellite IoT to help meet the current demands of the energy sector.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><em>DeltaV IO.CONNECT enables manufacturers to keep existing I/O infrastructure, shorten downtime, accelerate ROI and increase flexibility of capital expenditures</em></h3>
<p>AUSTIN, Texas (Oct. 12, 2022) – Emerson, a global software and engineering leader, has released <a href="https://www.emerson.com/en-us/automation/services-consulting/project-services/systems-project-services/feed/modernization-and-migration-services/io-connect" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DeltaV<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> IO.CONNECT</a>, a new subscription software service designed to help plants simplify modernization with an open architecture pathway that makes it possible to transition to more efficient control schemes without the need to completely overhaul existing infrastructure. In a traditional plant with tens of thousands of I/O points and many controllers, this can save hundreds or thousands of hours of labor and up to 40% of the capital required for a total rip-and-replace upgrade.</p>
<p>Many plants still using control systems from 20 or 30 years ago are unable to reap the benefits of modern, digital technologies that optimize operations and improve sustainability. Modernizing those systems is complicated by the extensive time, labor and capital expense required to convert the old wiring, terminations and other infrastructure they are built upon, leaving plants “locked in” to legacy control technologies and expensive service contracts.</p>
<p>DeltaV IO.CONNECT provides a faster, easier, more cost-effective path to replacing any legacy system with a new DeltaV distributed control system while leaving existing I/O infrastructure in place. The solution is provisioned as a subscription software component of Emerson’s <a href="https://www.emerson.com/en-us/automation/services-consulting/lifecycle-services/guardian-support" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guardian<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Support</a> offering, helping plants remain always up-to-date, driving strategic goals and meeting business needs with future-proof operation. No legacy vendor software is required for configuration and maintenance of I/O.</p>
<p>By preserving existing I/O and leaving wiring intact, plants can reduce new system transition time by over 90%, keeping production on pace, reducing risks and minimizing downtime. Once the interface is installed and the plant is running new control technologies, technicians can update I/O on their preferred schedule while the plant runs, shifting what used to be a capital expenditure to the operations budget and driving immediate return on investment through improved process control performance.</p>
<p>“Many best practices for better visibility and improved performance are out of reach for the numerous plants still running legacy equipment today,” said Claudio Fayad, vice president of technology for Emerson’s process systems and solutions business.</p>
<p>“Moreover, many of the oldest systems are reaching the end of their product support lifecycles, forcing some plants to modernize on a very tight schedule. DeltaV IO.CONNECT empowers industrial plants to choose a digital control system with all the advanced automation features they need, while still scaling at their own pace to better manage transition-related outages and capital expenditures,” said Fayad.</p>
<p>DeltaV IO.CONNECT will be on display at the <a href="https://www.emerson.com/en-us/automation/events/emerson-exchange" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emerson Global Users Exchange</a>, Oct. 24-28, 2022 in Grapevine, Texas.</p>

We’ve all heard of Smart Cities and <a href="https://www.iot-now.com/2021/06/11/110611-podcast-14-smart-homes-matter-but-will-they-be-secure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Smart Homes</a>, but the fully automated and IoT-enabled Smart Factory is also on the horizon. Indeed, it’s already possible today.</p>
<p>The IoT (<a href="https://www.iot-now.com/2021/09/01/112584-9-iot-applications-that-will-change-everything/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Internet of Things</a>) has proved its potential to revolutionise businesses across all sectors. When implemented correctly, it can streamline processes, improve decision-making, and create extra value for stakeholders, partners, and customers alike. It’s no wonder that it’s the main driving force behind Industry 4.0—what has been described as the “4th Industrial Revolution.”</p>
<h2><strong>What Is Industry 4.0?</strong></h2>
<p>Industry 4.0 refers to the process of digital transformation in manufacturing/production and related industries to create more value. Many consider the current digital transformation trend to be analogous to the 4th Industrial Revolution, hence the name.</p>
<p>Industry 4.0 is concerned with how manufacturing can transform, by using third-party platform technologies, innovation accelerators, and IT/OT (information technology/operational technology). This means incorporating cutting-edge technologies across cybersecurity, big data, AR/VR (augmented reality/virtual reality), cloud computing, automation, AI (artificial intelligence), and IoT to digitally transform conventional processes and capabilities (Figure 1). The goal is to make businesses smarter and faster as well as more resilient and agile.</p>

<h2><strong>Top 10 Industry 4.0 IoT Applications</strong></h2>
<p>Some of the top Industry 4.0 <a href="https://www.iot-now.com/world-of-iot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">use cases of IoT technology</a> follow.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Big Data and Analytics</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>As it stands, manufacturing businesses already produce copious amounts of data. This could come from IoT sensors, production volumes, sales forecast, performance data, and more. They also have to deal with a range of external data points and factors, such as market conditions, politics, the climate, and so on.</p>
<p>However, problems can arise when it comes to effectively storing, processing, and utilising that data. Manually collecting, organising, and sifting through data, not to mention gathering insights, is, historically, a time-consuming and laborious process. Worse, it’s a waste of human potential considering how efficient and adept technology is at handling big data. Big Data and analytics tools are transforming this side of business operations into one that happens virtually in real-time and with vastly increased intelligence applied.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Autonomous Robotics</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>While we might still be some way off humanoid robots, with human-like intelligence and dexterity, manufacturing automation is surprisingly mature. Robotic technology is already extensively deployed to perform repetitive, high-precision tasks in all kinds of production lines. The possible benefits of automated robotics in manufacturing are far-reaching, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facilitate continuous production with limited to no downtime.</li>
<li>Lower the risk of work-associated injuries from hazardous tasks.</li>
<li>Improved efficiency and productivity via fast and autonomous decision-making.</li>
</ul>
<p>More advanced robotics today don’t even require a human operator. They can self-navigate as well as itemise and step through a rapidly increasing number and variety of tasks.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Simulations and Digital Twins</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A digital twin is a virtual simulation or model of a real-world object, such as a piece of manufacturing equipment or an entire facility. The most common use case of these systems is to run simulations designed to identify inefficiencies and opportunities for improvement.</p>
<p>They can also be used to run pre-emptive tests of how a system or machine would perform in specific circumstances. What’s more, employees can be trained and educated using the equipment before being put in a real-life scenario. This can be particularly effective when combined with AI and machine learning technologies.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Horizontal and Vertical System Integration</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Horizontal integration ensures that your machinery, IoT devices, processes, and manpower work together seamlessly. On the other hand, vertical integration ensures this production data is available and actionable by different departments throughout the business.</p>
<p>The end goal is to establish seamless connectivity and organisation-wide visibility for those who need it. Data should be available and shareable between machines, employees, and even supply chain or business partners. This kind of interconnectedness could, for example, help prepare production for a delay in the supply chain or for sales to make decisions based on your manufacturing performance.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Industrial IoT (IIoT)</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>In a manufacturing context, IIoT is most often associated with device sensors that collect operational and environmental data. These sensors are the primary data input sources used to inform other verticals and make manufacturing processes and technology decisions. Aside from your manufacturing equipment, it can also apply to your facilities systems, such as air filtering; heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC); and other systems. This continuous collection and sharing of data underpin almost all other IoT systems.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Cybersecurity Technology</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Perhaps the only major downside to IoT-flying your entire operation is that the more interconnected your systems are, the more significant the potential security risks. Any single IoT device can be a possible entry point for an attack, from where it can rapidly spread to all other devices and systems within your business operations stack.</p>
<p>However, this risk can be mitigated by using cutting-edge IoT cybersecurity systems. Today’s leading IoT security systems leverage technologies, such as AI, machine learning, and blockchain to respond to attacks automatically. These intelligent security systems can protect against a wide variety of attacks, from social engineering to ransomware to DDoS (distributed denial-of-service). Parts of the IoT network can be quarantined and cleaned up without bringing the entire system down. What’s more, fine-tuned configurations and access controls can improve security as a whole.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong>The Cloud</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The cloud comes with the promise of never-before-seen scalability, flexibility, and speed-to-market for businesses across all industries. Cloud infrastructure is cheap, secure, fast, and comes pre-configured with data redundancies and business continuity measures.</p>
<p>Enterprises can outsource specific needs and business processes to the cloud, whether SaaS (software as a service), CaaS (containers as a service), IaaS (infrastructure as a service), or XaaS (anything as a service). Cloud manufacturing has even emerged to synchronise manufacturing across geographically dispersed locations.</p>
<p>Data can be stored in near-endless amounts, with easy and quick access for all stakeholders, including customers. The cloud offers numerous benefits from a consumer-facing perspective regarding speed, availability, and reliability. Not to mention reducing overhead costs when procuring, maintaining, and operating infrastructure.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li><strong>Additive Manufacturing (AM)</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>AM is the industrial production name for 3D printing. 3D printing itself is the process of manufacturing products by adding more materials in layers. Computer-aided design (CAD) or 3D object scanners can be used to create digital models of objects, which can then be printed in 3D. This opens many doors for manufacturers including crowdsourcing designs, ideas, and user-generated content. Even AI can be combined with Big Data to create AI-generated innovations or inventions.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li><strong>Artificial Intelligence and Manufacturing</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We have already alluded to several uses for AI in IIoT. It is fair to say that AI will inevitably suffuse almost every digital technology thanks to its potential for speed, efficiency, and automation. It’s already seeing large-scale use in making predictions regarding market trends, supply and demand, and even maintenance.</p>
<p>Aided by Big Data and machine learning, the potential of AI will only increase. For example, machines can become capable of identifying and solving inefficiencies independently of human input.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li><strong>Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>AR and VR may have experienced setbacks due to a misalignment between expectations and reality. However, it’s now slowly gaining ground once more as a transformative technology across all vectors.</p>
<p>AR overlays can give boots-on-the-ground instant access to rich contextual data. For example, it’s easy to imagine AR lenses that provide information on individual packages as a floor manager walks through a warehouse. Someone wearing an AR device can even receive instant alerts, tooltips, or hazardous material warnings. Both AR and VR can also be used for training using immersive, realistic simulations—possibly combined with digital twins.</p>
<h2><strong>Are You Excited About Industry 4.0 IoT and What It Can Do for Your Business?</strong></h2>
<p>It is important to note that this technology is not solely for the use of huge enterprises; there are also innumerable use cases for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). However, whilst the smart factory ideal is more attainable than ever, you should never go into a digital transformation unprepared.</p>
<p>If you haven’t undertaken this type of operation before, you should talk with a managed IT expert with a track record of helping SMEs achieve sustainable success through digital transformation. This should help you avoid all the most common pitfalls, such as a lack of strategy or the necessary IT skills.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <figure class="image"><a target="_blank" href=" https://www.powermag.com/zero-trust-protecting-critical-infrastructure-and-responding-to-cisas-shields-up/ "/> <img width="600" height="338" src="https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/fig-2-cybersecurity.jpg" class="attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" loading="lazy" srcset="https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/fig-2-cybersecurity.jpg 600w, https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/fig-2-cybersecurity-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/fig-2-cybersecurity-213x120.jpg 213w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></figure>
<p>There are no boundaries in cyberspace. That fact has accelerated sharing of threat intelligence across the defenders, but it exponentially raises the threat of cyberattacks.</p>
<p>This reality is underscored by the war in Ukraine, “the first major conflict involving <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/cyber-war-and-ukraine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large-scale cyber operations</a>,” according to the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA). A major concern is that malicious activity—such as <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-057a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wiper attacks</a> that erase all data from hard drives—will spill over from Ukraine to other nations, including the U.S.</p>
<p>In April 2022, for instance, the U.S. government <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/06/us/politics/us-russia-malware-cyberattacks.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">secretly removed malware</a> from organizations around the world to preemptively thwart Russia-backed cyberattacks. CISA’s latest “<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/shields-up" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shields Up</a>” campaign advises that “every organization—large and small—must be prepared to respond to disruptive cyber incidents.”</p>
<p>The power industry is no exception. Critical infrastructure is a highly vulnerable target for rogue nations. These malicious actors have strong incentives and dedicated resources for undermining our national security. And with sometimes outdated operational technology (OT) and limited cybersecurity regulations, critical infrastructure has already fallen victim to attacks, such as the <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/Colonial-Pipeline-hack-explained-Everything-you-need-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Colonial Pipeline breach</a> that halted vital petroleum operations in 2021.</p>
<p>The good news is that highly attainable strategies and technologies can protect power industry enterprises from cyberattacks and reduce their cyber risk.</p>
<h2>The Power of Zero Trust</h2>
<p>“Zero Trust” has become a byword in government cybersecurity, with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) issuing detailed guidelines on achieving a <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-207.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zero Trust architecture</a>. Zero Trust is also increasingly embraced by the private sector, and the electric power industry should be no exception.</p>
<p>The concept behind Zero Trust is “never trust, always verify.” That means, for instance, not allowing users to gain access to a system once and then move laterally throughout the network. Rather, Zero Trust requires that all users, devices, applications, and other entities verify their identity each and every time they attempt to access a system or data.</p>
<p>For example, many organizations currently allow employees and contractors to use virtual private networks (VPNs) to access corporate resources from remote devices. Once those users log in over the VPN, they can potentially reach all company systems and data.</p>
<p>A far more secure approach is Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA), which requires that workers and devices use only specific network protocols, and which limits access only to the data and systems those entities are specifically authorized to use. That way, cyberattacks don’t spread from one system or network to another.</p>
<h2>Ensuring Least-Privilege Access</h2>
<p>But employees no longer access data and applications only in corporate data centers. Today, information technology (IT) resources reside wherever business needs to get done. Workloads might operate in Google Cloud, documents might be stored in Microsoft 365, data might be shared in Dropbox, and so on.</p>
<p>As a result, the “attack surface” of your organization has grown considerably. The perimeter of the network is no longer the four walls of your building. So, it’s no longer adequate to simply protect the perimeter.</p>
<p>The solution begins with the concept of least-privilege access, which gives users only the IT privileges they require to do their jobs. For example, if users only need to use certain data on certain systems, they shouldn’t be able to access other data on other systems. Nor should they be able to perform tasks such as installing new software or running data backups.</p>
<p>Implementing least-privilege access starts with knowing who is accessing your data and how they’re accessing it. Most organizations lack clear visibility into this. Effective cybersecurity tools can help you understand and control who’s reaching which data and systems—and help prevent attackers from using stolen credentials to wreak havoc on your network.</p>
<h2>The MFA Imperative</h2>
<p>Another crucial tool for protecting data and systems is multifactor authorization (MFA). In the past, MFA was seen as state-of-the-art, but in the face of today’s advanced persistent threats, it’s an absolute must.</p>
<p>MFA combines what the user knows (a password), who the user is (a biometric), and what the user has (a device or token). Even stronger MFA adds an “out-of-band” element such as a code sent to a smartphone or a challenge-and-response step the user has to click through.</p>
<p>Banks and other businesses that deal in sensitive data use MFA to reinforce their security. Enterprises in the power industry should, as well. MFA ensures that passwords aren’t the only barrier between your data and a malicious actor. In fact, Microsoft research shows that accounts are <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/concept-fundamentals-mfa-get-started" target="_blank" rel="noopener">99.9% less likely</a> to be compromised with MFA.</p>
<h2>Content Disarm and Reconstruction</h2>
<p>A final aspect of cybersecurity that operators of critical infrastructure shouldn’t overlook is protecting digital content. That includes all the Microsoft and Google documents, PDFs, images, and so on that your teams create, access, and share every day.</p>
<p>The text, images, and other elements in digital files are encoded using standard formats. But cyber attackers can also hide malicious code in those files. When the infected file is opened, the malicious code executes, potentially damaging systems or stealing data.</p>
<p>The solution is content disarm and reconstruction (CDR). CDR works by deconstructing and reconstructing files as they traverse your network in real time. The technology extracts the valid code from a file and then builds a new, fully functional but malware-free file. The original file, along with any hidden malware, is quarantined or destroyed.</p>
<p>CDR shifts the focus from file-based malware detection to prevention. Instead of seeking out a malware needle in the haystack of files moving around your enterprise, CDR takes a Zero Trust approach, assuming that all content is potentially dangerous and ensuring that all files are rendered safe. Modern CDR technology is able to perform these functions and sanitize content faster than traditional security antivirus.</p>
<p>For operators of critical infrastructure, the hazards of new, more persistent and more dangerous cyberthreats will continue. In response, organizations up and down the power supply chain must take new steps in protecting their systems and data. Fortunately, there are proven strategies and technologies for safeguarding your operations. These solutions could literally keep the lights on—for your business and for the customers you serve.</p>

Rather than being a subject of ongoing debate and divided opinions, global warming has instigated radical reform throughout Middle Eastern society, inspiring nations to introduce abatement imperatives, enact meaningful change, and embark on a net zero future.</p>
<p>The journey thus far has been progressive, each new milestone another step closer to overcoming the climate conundrum. Yet, to forge the net zero future that national leaderships and the region envisages, the wider energy sector must play a starring energy transition role by embracing digital technologies.</p>
<h2>A Vibrant Digital Development Destination</h2>
<p>To better understand the region’s ever-unfolding digitalization setting, one need only look to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia—two countries championing digital transformation and consolidating the Middle East’s status as a robust jurisdiction for tech-based advancement.</p>
<p>In April 2022, the UAE launched the Digital Economy Strategy, which aims for double digital economy gross domestic product (GDP) contributions <a href="https://u.ae/en/about-the-uae/strategies-initiatives-and-awards/federal-governments-strategies-and-plans/digital-economy-strategy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from 9.7% to 19.4% over the coming decade</a>. The Digital Economy Strategy will consolidate modern technologies adoption efforts, with more than 30 initiatives, projects, and programs, as well as five new growth areas, further <a href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/uae/government/2022/04/11/uae-cabinet-approves-strategy-to-have-20-digital-contribution-to-non-oil-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">elevating digital progression and future preparedness in the process</a>.</p>
<p>Digital transformation has also been embraced in Saudi Arabia in line with Vision 2030, with the Kingdom currently pursuing its third five-year action plan for realizing a smart government. Under the National Strategy for Digital Transformation, the Smart Government Strategy (2020–2024) is implementing innovative approaches for building world-class digital government capabilities. In turn, such strategies have solidified the foundations for an Industry 4.0-inspired, energy sector-driven energy transition.</p>
<h2>With Technology Comes Trajectory</h2>
<p>Across the energy sector, digital transformation is driving continuous decarbonization. New technologies are enabling national oil companies (NOCs) to reduce emissions, paving the way for a net zero future. One such technology is artificial intelligence (AI), which is proving decisive behind accurate renewable energy forecasting, optimized operations, stabilized energy grids, sustainable energy assets distribution, and shaping tomorrow’s interconnected energy systems.</p>
<p>AI has become fundamental for utilizing renewables including solar and wind power, and its future decarbonization importance is further emphasized as AI technologies can create value up to $5.8 trillion annually <a href="https://www.arabnews.com/node/1632216/business-economy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">across 19 different energy industries</a>, thus revolutionizing the energy sector.</p>
<p>Data-driven insights are another energy transition enabler that have become imperative for developing smart systems capable of supporting widespread decarbonization. Data utilization is ensuring digitalization impacts manifest across the entire energy sector value chain, from forecasting and efficiency to optimization and longevity. Looking ahead, NOCs can record greater decarbonization achievements with support from big data technologies. They can elevate exploration, production, shipping, and transportation efficiencies; reduce drilling times; optimize production pump performance; enhance reservoir engineering; and deliver emissions reductions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, digital twins are streamlining operational improvements and increasing energy production at many clean energy developments, with the internet of things (IoT), AI, and software analytics collectively creating reliable simulations while enhancing output through efficient data-driven maintenance and management. With digital twin software, companies can monitor resource consumption, boost production efficiencies, and plan green energy production upgrades in due course, as well as make more informed emissions reduction decisions and accelerate the energy transition.</p>
<p>NOCs aside, key energy industry players are also behind net zero progression, as has been showcased at the prestigious ADIPEC Awards, where projects driving transformational change while building a future-proof energy industry are celebrated. Among them is Siemens Energy, the 2021 “Innovation in Decarbonization Company of the Year” category winner. Last year, the organization was recognized for developing emissions reductions solutions using Industry 4.0 technologies.</p>
<p>These examples belong to an extensively expanding use case portfolio that demonstrates how digital transformation is an energy transition catalyst. An essential next step must, however, be urgently pursued to continue capitalizing on energy sector digitalization opportunities.</p>
<h2>Collaborate to Accomplish</h2>
<p>With a net zero future now a real possibility, energy sector companies, investors, and respective leaderships alike must advance the energy transition agenda by broadening collaboration and engaging in industry-wide data sharing. Digital disruption is a trend certain to continue evolving at an unprecedented rate, and constructive, long-term digital partnerships are critical for building and developing ecosystems that understand emerging transformation drivers, successfully implement the latest technologies, and unlock new digital decarbonization opportunities and value.</p>
<p>By welcoming a new wave of collaboration and data-sharing, these outcomes will undoubtedly follow as the wider energy sector enables innovation, activates more sustainable operations, introduces decarbonized products, and overcomes climate challenges. We will look back at this time in history, and the embracing of digital solutions as an enabler for the energy transition, as a milestone moment in the net zero journey.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>CLEVELAND (August 16, 2022) — </strong>Intelligent power management company Eaton today announced new research on the relevance of the energy transition in digital transformation planning for power-critical businesses. Commissioned by Eaton, this S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence report – <a href="https://www.eaton.com/us/en-us/digital/brightlayer/brightlayer-report-digital-transformation-and-energy-transition.html"><em>The Intersection of Digital Transformation and the Energy Transition</em></a><em> </em>– highlights that although 77% of companies surveyed expect to transition away from their current power sources, only half are currently executing the digital strategies needed to navigate this shift. In addition, less than a third of companies track key sustainability and energy intelligence metrics, and even fewer (17%) have digitally enabled legacy systems.</p>
<p>“We identified a major gap in how businesses are applying digitalization to realize decarbonization goals and this research is a wakeup call, shedding light on the opportunities for businesses to focus investments and make a bigger impact,” said Aravind Yarlagadda, executive vice president and chief digital officer at Eaton. “Businesses need to move far faster on digital transformation. The good news is that the time for action is now, and tools like our Brightlayer digital foundation help businesses gain deeper energy insights that are essential to evaluate worthwhile investments. Our industry-specific software suites are already helping customers meet these challenges.”</p>
<p>The study included 1,001 respondents who are involved in digital transformation efforts across four power-critical business sectors in North America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, including: buildings, data centers, industrials and utilities.</p>
<p>“Until now, enterprise transformation projects have focused primarily on optimizing business processes. The coming energy transition will impact digital best practices and processes and will prove an important competitive differentiator for firms that are first to embrace that approach,” according to Rich Karpinski, senior analyst, 451 Research, part of S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.</p>
<h2>Sector Research Findings</h2>
<p><strong>Building owners and operators</strong> made clear power optimization and ESG reporting are critical issues. Sustainability is the top goal for this sector, prioritized by 46% of the sector respondent. Yet, building owners are skeptical that smart building initiatives will pay off: the top digital challenges include calculating a favorable cost/benefit analysis (cited by 52% building survey respondents) and a lack of pressing digital use cases (45%).</p>
<p><strong>Data centers</strong> have embraced digitalization and are now looking for next-generation digital opportunities to either streamline operations or generate revenue to create competitive advantages. Next-step goals involve increasing use of renewables, cited by 50% of data center owners; improving energy storage, according to 47% of respondents; and making money selling power back to the grid, chosen by 34%.</p>
<p><strong>Industrials</strong> have focused digitalization efforts on perennial challenges like addressing skilled worker shortages. Yet, digitalization addressing energy transition lags. Only 24% of industrials cited energy and power concerns as a key digital driver for industrial transformation. For industrials to maintain or gain a competitive upper hand, applying digitalization to the energy transition will be a key advantage.</p>
<p><strong>Utilities</strong> are facing massive shifts in energy generation as renewables increase along with the need for increased digital intelligence. Digital transformation is essential to new business models and revenue sources, including support for electric vehicles (EV) through customer EV-charging needs (identified by 49% of utility respondents) or EV charging stations themselves (cited by 45%).</p>

<p>Digital transformation is key to making industries more agile, resilient, and sustainable. These are essential qualities if businesses are not only to survive but thrive in the Industry 4.0 era—and the energy industry is no exception.</p>
<p>With price volatility set to continue in the natural gas and carbon energy markets, and growing pricing pressure coming from wind and solar, energy operators must increase agility and resilience in their power generation to allow them to respond more flexibly and reliably. At the same time, more is being asked of them from a regulatory perspective, and many are working toward net zero goals.</p>
<p>While power generation plant sub-systems have long relied on automation for accurate fuel delivery, to regulate pressure, and transfer power to transmission and distribution systems, power plant operators are taking automation to a new level, turning to industrial-grade private wireless to support their digital transformations. Many plants today use Wi-Fi connectivity, but this technology is susceptible to interference and doesn’t provide the coverage, capacity, low-latency connectivity, or quality of service to reliably connect critical operations on a larger scale. The upgrade to Wi-Fi 6 will enhance the capacity, latency, and data rate, but should still only be reserved for connecting information technology (IT) applications.</p>
<p>Designed to provide reliable coverage in areas with high interference, industrial-grade private 4G/LTE and 5G broadband wireless networks are perfectly suited to support the digitalization of power plant operations. They allow plant operators to connect numerous low-cost, low-power Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) sensors to assets flexibly and securely to access huge volumes of real-time operational data. This enables the implementation of Industry 4.0 applications (Figure 1), allowing plant operators to apply machine learning, artificial intelligence (AI), advanced analytics, and more to this data to gain new value and intelligence.</p>
<figure id="attachment_176821" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-176821" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-176821" src="https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/fig1-nokia-industrial-lte-device.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="480" srcset="https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/fig1-nokia-industrial-lte-device.jpg 720w, https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/fig1-nokia-industrial-lte-device-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-176821" class="wp-caption-text"><em>1. Smartphones, tablets, and other digital devices connected to wireless networks at power plant locations enhance workers’ capabilities, saving time and money in the long run. Courtesy: Nokia</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>When using private LTE Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) connectivity to IIoT sensors, tasks that were previously too costly are made possible, such as the remote monitoring of processes and equipment including cooling towers, retention ponds, steam traps, and pH levels and corrosion. Team safety and efficiency can be enhanced too.</p>
<h2>Growing the Communications Toolkit to Enhance Safety</h2>
<p>Private wireless networks already play a vital role in enhancing worker safety for many industries. Supporting the push-to-talk voice feature enabled by traditional ultra-high-frequency (UHF)/very-high-frequency (VHF), TErrestrial Trunked RAdio (TETRA), and Project 25 (P25) radio systems, private 4G/LTE and 5G networks can be a workplace safety technology supporting a dramatically enhanced toolkit for maintenance teams and other onsite personnel.</p>
<p>Leveraging high-bandwidth, low-latency connectivity allows maintenance workers to share real-time video with central control teams and remote specialists to speed up issue identification and resolution. Logs, schematics, and current and historical operational information can also be delivered to the worker’s device, so all critical data is available in real-time. Additionally, for greater insight and assistance, data can be overlaid directly onto the equipment being worked on using artificial reality.</p>
<p>Artificial reality and virtual reality can also be used to enhance training by providing a ‘real-feel’ training environment wherever the trainee is. New recruits are afforded more time to train on expensive equipment and in a range of hazardous situations in safety, while experienced engineers can be updated on new techniques, safety procedures, and technologies.</p>
<p>Real-time data feeds from environmental sensors at power generation plants can alert onsite and central teams to critical issues, such as gas leaks or a rise in radiation levels, before they become dangerous. Wearable sensors allow teams to monitor the vital health signs of workers and quickly respond if they get into difficulty. Additionally, wearable body cameras provide additional insight for control teams and first responders, giving a greater understanding of a situation and allowing them to pinpoint the location of injured personnel.</p>
<p>Workers have even more flexibility to communicate with their teams without having to remove protective gloves or helmets using industrial-grade LTE user equipment (Figure 2). This includes a growing ecosystem of ruggedized devices, including hand-held remote speaker microphones (RSM), helmets integrated with headsets, and noise cancellation headsets that can be implemented and managed using private LTE networks.</p>
<figure id="attachment_176822" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-176822" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-176822" src="https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/fig2-nokia-industrial-lte-device.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="480" srcset="https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/fig2-nokia-industrial-lte-device.jpg 720w, https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/fig2-nokia-industrial-lte-device-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-176822" class="wp-caption-text"><em>2. Industrial-grade LTE devices connected to wireless networks help workers troubleshoot problems and document issues. Courtesy: Nokia</em></figcaption></figure>
<h2>Managing Site Security</h2>
<p>The sheer size and location of some power plants can mean it’s too costly to employ staff to monitor and secure all areas in-person 24/7. But pervasive private LTE network coverage allows plant operators to quickly connect new sensors and devices to significantly broaden the reach of their security teams, whatever the location.</p>
<p>Geo-fencing applications can be used for the security and safety of workers and the public. If a worker enters an area that should be avoided, their wearable sensor can trigger an alarm. These types of applications can also be used at remote plants, alerting central security teams to any unauthorized activity at a site. To further limit human activity in restricted sites where it could be too hazardous for a person to work, remote-controlled robots can be activated on the network to automate maintenance activities.</p>
<p>By connecting drones and robots equipped with cameras, plant operators can enable additional monitoring at large and remote sites for enhanced safety and security. Drones can be operated by personnel connected to the private LTE network or set to follow routine patrol paths. By equipping drones with speakers, they can be used to notify members of the public that they are in a restricted or hazardous location. Using machine learning techniques and AI, anomalies on video feeds, such as human activity where none is expected, can be automatically detected and trigger alerts to security teams to investigate.</p>
<h2>Optimizing Operational Efficiency with a Holistic View of Data</h2>
<p>The pervasive low-latency connectivity provided by industrial-grade private LTE networks will take on even greater importance as wholesale price volatility continues. With an end-to-end view of operations, plant operators will have tighter control over assets, gaining a greater understanding of performance trade-offs.</p>
<p>By leveraging continuous data feeds, automated anomaly detection and alerts, and maintenance activities, will become predictive. If potential problems are detected, teams can resolve them before they become an issue, meaning repair costs are reduced, and the lifecycle of equipment is extended. Remote inspections will allow plant operators to keep costs down as more isolated sites are integrated into the distribution system.</p>
<p>Even as new assets are added within a power plant, a private LTE network will connect them more rapidly and cost-effectively than fiber and more reliably than Wi-Fi. Plant operators can also leverage sensor data to implement digital twins, which allow them to see how changes impact operations before committing to the cost of implementing them in the real world. Digital twins are particularly effective for critical functions such as asset management, resource and expansion planning, and computerized maintenance and management systems.</p>
<h2>Adopting a Future-Proof Technology with Consolidated Operations</h2>
<p>Today’s power plants consist of multiple communications networks for operations, including private radio, Wi-Fi, and other wireless IoT systems, such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), Long-Range Radio (LoRa), and other unlicensed narrowband wireless technologies. A private LTE network allows them to incorporate, complement, or replace these technologies and consolidate operations, reducing the time and cost of maintaining and securing separate networks. And there’s no need to compromise on space as 4G/LTE and 5G small cell radios are typically the size of Wi-Fi access points.</p>
<p>With the ability to implement 4G/LTE and smoothly evolve to 5G when applications require it, a private wireless network offers numerous capabilities for plant operators. There is a well-established and growing vendor ecosystem of 4G/LTE-equipped sensors, devices, applications, and connected personal protection equipment. Many of those vendors are now launching similar devices and equipment for 5G.</p>
<p>The digitalization of power plant operations is a catalyst for a new era of communications technology optimized for operational transformation. By adopting an industry standards-based technology that will allow them to simply integrate a mix of vendors’ offerings, power plants will have the greatest flexibility and resilience in their operations.</p>
<p>Industrial-grade private wireless will help manage the juggling act of driving down costs and implementing new agility and responsiveness to enhance operations and worker safety, helping power plant operators to achieve their Industry 4.0 goals. </p>

<p><strong><em>The U.S. will rely on utility leaders to scale smart grid infrastructure and reduce carbon emissions.</em></strong></p>
<p>Climate change has captured the world’s attention for decades. We’ve seen countless intergovernmental summits, worldwide protests, and documentaries on global warming over the years. Although momentum has been building across the public and private sectors, leaders are preparing for a new, accelerated leg in the race to clean energy as <a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/us-launches-net-zero-world-initiative-accelerate-global-energy-system-decarbonization" target="_blank" rel="noopener">America positions itself to meet the 2050 net zero emissions promise</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/06/fact-sheet-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Infrastructure and Investments Job Act</a> is expected to significantly fast track the country’s clean energy commitments, introducing plans for nationwide electric vehicle (EV) charging, public transportation fleet conversion, and legacy pollution mitigation, as well as federal funding options for companies prioritizing green energy campaigns. What’s more, <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/energy/state-electric-vehicle-incentives-state-chart.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">state-sponsored EV incentives</a> and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s pending <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-46" target="_blank" rel="noopener">carbon reporting regulations</a> have further demonstrated America’s intentions.</p>
<p>Although oil and gas companies and automotive manufacturers have recently been capturing the nation’s attention with their energy transition agendas and investments in green energy–powered factories and vehicles, utilities have been progressing for the better part of two decades against net zero goals, even before the term was coined. With the long migration from coal to renewables, propelled by things like the Clean Air Interstate Rule, Investment Tax Credit for wind, and many variations of state Renewable Portfolio Standard rules, utilities have slowly but surely contributed to America’s clean energy foundation. However, utility leaders have the opportunity to further propel their organizations and bid for newly available federal grants—like their oil and gas counterparts. </p>
<h2>Helping Grids Meet Green Energy Goals</h2>
<p>To stake their claim in the evolving market and ensure their green energy agendas are successful, utility companies must modernize their grid infrastructures and develop new, transformational strategies while federal funding is still available. <a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-fact-sheet-bipartisan-infrastructure-deal-will-deliver-american-workers-families-and-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">With a $3 billion expansion of the Smart Grid Investment Matching Grant Program, and $11 billion in grants available for state entities and utilities to enhance infrastructure resilience</a>, the future is bright for utilities willing to enter the federal bidding process. This injection of cash flow will likely prove to be pivotal for organizations as they modernize their grid infrastructures while enabling their stakeholders broader decarbonization agendas.</p>
<p>But to get the best bang for their buck, utilities need to develop efficient digital grid transformation strategies. Given the rapidly evolving and tech-focused nature of the clean energy landscape, enterprises should initially focus their time and money on the following four key tactics.</p>
<p><strong>Network Instrumentation.</strong> Private organizations, government entities, and consumers alike will soon demand localized insights into energy consumption and delivery patterns, and these insights will only be made possible using network instrumentation solutions across the nation’s vast grid network. These specialized, connected industrial communication networks will require utilities to install and connect sensors, smart substations, and edge of the grid computing.</p>
<p><strong>Grid Security and Resilience.</strong> In recent years, American energy and utilities companies have been well aware of the <a href="https://www.gao.gov/blog/solarwinds-cyberattack-demands-significant-federal-and-private-sector-response-infographic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cybersecurity gaps</a> that are created when undergoing widespread digital transformation journeys linking operational, information, and network technology solutions. Revamping grid infrastructure poses such risks for utility leaders, which is why automating and optimizing grid operations to ensure stability, resiliency, and security must be at the top of enterprises’ agendas. </p>
<p><strong>Advanced Asset Management.</strong> Although some utilities may think their asset management practice is tried and true, it will also require an overhaul to match the pace of other “smart” capabilities that will soon transform grids across the nation. Leaders will soon need an integrated view of their assets, using tools such as advanced dashboards to monitor aspects such as performance, health, interoperability, and system capability contribution.</p>
<p><strong>Data-Driven Ecosystems.</strong> Like so many other companies across industries that are revamping their digital transformation agendas, data will be the backbone of utilities’ smart grid strategies. The grids of tomorrow will leverage data-driven insights to power artificial intelligence, automation, and many other solutions and services. But to do that, enterprises will first need to set technical foundations and pre-defined, extensible data models, as well as improve access to data sets.</p>
<h2>Strike While the Iron Is Hot</h2>
<p>With billions of dollars on the table and pressure coming from consumers and governmental bodies alike, now is the time for utility companies to develop transformational grid infrastructure strategies, bid for federal funds, and reposition themselves in the evolving energy transition market. Although the journey to fully scaled smart grids will be long, leaders who prioritize transformation agendas will place their organizations ahead of the pack, helping their service territories to realize net zero’s full potential, strengthening their regulatory posture, and sharpening their competitive edge as the U.S. sets its sights on 2050.</p>

<p>The energy and utilities sector is not just the lifeblood of the world’s economy, but fundamental to society’s existence as a whole. Yet, recent events have highlighted just how volatile and unpredictable it can be. Output is influenced by everything from weather patterns to war, and no business, consumer, or household is immune from the resulting impact.</p>
<p>When things go wrong—from blackouts to supply challenges—the potential for negative impact is huge. It’s no surprise, then, that this sector is a prime target for those hungry to create disorder and disruption: cybercriminals.</p>
<h2>A Drive to Digitalisation</h2>
<p>The energy sector experienced rapid digital transformation during the pandemic as companies sought to maintain operations at a time of social distancing. When you couple this with innovations that were already being adopted to reduce emissions and maximise efficiency, it’s clear that this sector has undergone significant change as it embraced digital. </p>
<p>But with every advancement made, the potential attack surface has expanded—providing more opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit and creating a more complex IT estate, which can be harder for security teams to police. The potential for a situation where digital transformation and bad actor risk outpaces cybersecurity strategies and investment is worryingly common. Indeed, you don’t need to look far for evidence of criminals trying to take advantage of this gap.</p>
<h2>A Prime Target for Attacks</h2>
<p>The situation in Ukraine has presented new and significant concerns for governments as well as putting the world’s cyber defence authorities on high alert. In April, Western governments jointly warned about <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/west-warns-russian-cyberattacks-critical-infrastructure-2022-04-20/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the potential threat of increased malicious cyber activity by Russia</a> against critical infrastructure in response to sanctions imposed as punishment for its invasion of Ukraine. And this wouldn’t be the first time. In 2017, what is believed to be a state-sponsored bad actor group hacked into the servers of a Ukrainian accounting software provider and sent corrupted software updates to the company’s customers. The ransomware-like virus, named NotPetya, spread globally and crippled operations across multiple industries, including energy, costing over $10 billion in damages.</p>
<p>Yet, attacks on critical infrastructure are not solely borne from the Russia-Ukraine conflict. In fact, concerns have been building for the last few years around the potential for life, property, and environment-compromising cyberattacks against critical infrastructure. From the 2021 shutdown-inducing attack on the U.S. Colonial Pipeline—deemed a national security threat—to a recent <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/02/cyberattack-amsterdam-rotterdam-antwerp-energy-sector/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cyberattack on the major European oil refining hubs</a> of Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp (ARA), it’s clear this sector is an attractive target for criminals. We’ve also seen the significant disruption that can be caused, with attacks in this sector triggering cascading effects that impact business operations and the economy in countries much further afield.</p>
<h2>Unique Industry Challenges</h2>
<p>The global energy sector must take steps to shore up its cyber defences. Unfortunately, the energy sector is beset with complexities that make this challenging, particularly within operations in industrial environments where equipment and means of production are expected to last several decades, making rapid upgrades or changes difficult. In fact, our recent <a href="https://www.trellix.com/en-us/assets/docs/tcrr-path-to-cyber-readiness-preparation-perception-and-partnership.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cyber Readiness Report</a> found 94% of government agencies and critical infrastructure providers around the world report challenges in implementing endpoint detection and response, extended detection and response, multifactor authentication, and zero-trust architecture technologies. In fact, less than a third (29%) of critical infrastructure companies have zero-trust architecture, and only 37% have fully deployed multifactor authentication.</p>
<p>There are other challenges too. While most utilities have become aware of the risks associated with cybersecurity, inconsistencies still exist in their ability to secure funding to invest in OT and IT cybersecurity controls. Our research for the Cyber Readiness report found a lack of in-house staff resources appears to be one of the greatest barriers to implementing new cybersecurity solutions for this sector, with <a href="https://www.trellix.com/en-gb/about/newsroom/stories/perspectives/cyber-readiness-of-us-oil-gas-sector.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">55% of respondents identifying it as a critical challenge</a>. This is preventing the industry from proactively getting on the front foot to deal with emerging cyber threats. It draws distinct parallels to the gradual adoption of physical safety practices in the energy industry over the past 50 years, and like its manual and analogue predecessor, urgently needs addressing.</p>
<h2>Managing the Evolving Threat Landscape</h2>
<p>Leaders within the energy industry need to build cyber resilience into their organisations and partnerships to continue providing reliable, timely services to their customers, no matter what the future holds in terms of cyber threats. However, after years of digital transformation, many are dealing with a patchwork of technology and cybersecurity solutions. This plethora of tools creates yet more challenges for IT security teams. Alerts get missed, too much time is spent pivoting between tools to search for anomalies, and not enough time is left for actively remediating vulnerabilities. In short, teams struggle to manage the rapidly evolving threat landscape when held back with siloed security.</p>
<p>To address these SecOps challenges, organisations should consider implementing a flexible, scalable XDR (extended detection and response) architecture that offers native integration with their current security tools and connects all the dots to eliminate security gaps. When data is fed into a centralised platform and correlated with other data in a native and open environment, alerts become actionable and SecOps team gain single pane-of-glass visibility into every system. This saves time and makes it tougher for criminals to exploit a weakness. Importantly, it also reduces administrative fatigue amongst the SecOps team and helps alleviate the pressure points that can contribute to burn-out.</p>
<h2>Improving the Level of Protection in the Sector</h2>
<p>Cyberattacks on the energy sector are not going away, so action is urgently needed. This responsibility extends beyond IT teams to the energy sector’s top executives and board members.</p>
<p>These leaders need to mitigate cyber risk in a sector that is undergoing a digital revolution and frequently targeted by cyber criminals, whether for geopolitical purposes or financial gain. It is essential that the sector not only learns from previous attacks, but also continues to proactively improve protection levels and boost resilience in order to navigate the cyber threats ahead.</p>

<p class="p4"><b>SAN RAMON, Calif. – JUNE 6, 2022 &#8212; </b><a href="https://www.ge.com/digital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">GE Digital </span></a>today announced a technology partnership with <a href="https://visionaize.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">Visionaize</span></a>, a provider of world-class operational 3D Digital Twin solutions. This technology is designed to help empower data-driven businesses with high accuracy visualization capabilities for operational use cases that can help to save time, reduce cost, and improve safety. Visionaize’s V-Suite Starter can be incorporated into GE Digital’s <a href="https://www.ge.com/digital/applications/asset-performance-management/apm-integrity" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">APM Mechanical Integrity</span><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> software</a> designed to help streamline maintenance activities and improve worker efficiency across asset intensive industries.</p>
<p class="p4">While industrial companies can choose to review data and information in any number of formats including plant blueprints, Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&amp;ID), and Isometrics through various means of CAD/CAM software solutions, the implementation of V-Suite Starter is designed to allow users to view real-time and historical asset data on the 3D model to deliver timely and valuable insights at the point of action. The 3D visualizations of key asset information combine “see it, model it, and understand future behavior” to help asset-intensive companies solve key challenges associated with asset downtime, quicker time to resolution, maintenance costs, and workforce productivity.</p>
<p class="p4">Visionaize integrates 3D plant models with APM Mechanical Integrity to provide data-driven visualization of key APM Integrity attributes by color coding the model to filter out noise and focus on what matters most. The ability to dynamically visualize and contextualize data for operations and maintenance activities help make inspectors, planners, maintenance technicians, corrosion analysts, and Risk Based Inspection (RBI) analysts more efficient and effective in their daily jobs.</p>
<p class="p4">“As companies in asset-centric industries &#8212; Oil &amp;Gas, Power Generation, Petrochemical, and Mining &#8212; look to enhance their digital transformation journey, there is a growing acceptance to absorb Digital Twins into their operational decision-making workflows,” said David Reinhart, Executive Vice President for Visionaize. “To build out a more robust Digital Twin experience, there is a pressing need for rapid contextual awareness and visualization capabilities.”</p>
<p class="p4">Utilizing 3D visualization in GE Digital’s APM solution can help improve worker safety and productivity with situational awareness and less time spent in hazardous environments. An accurate 3D model is designed to allow recovery planning even before workers can access the site itself to facilitate faster time to resolution. And it can help to optimize maintenance programs with more efficient scheduling to accelerate planned and unplanned downtime activities.</p>
<p class="p4">“Our partnership with Visionaize brings an enhanced scalable templated capability to APM that accelerates implementation and simplifies replication across sites and reduces implementation costs,” said Linda Rae, General Manager of GE Digital’s Power Generation and Oil &amp; Gas business. “Incorporating this state-of-the-art visualization platform is valuable as asset-intensive companies mature in their operational use of Digital Twins.”</p>
