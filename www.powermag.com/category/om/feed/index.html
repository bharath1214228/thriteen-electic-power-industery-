										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><em>Cast-iron motors meet or exceed NEMA Premium® efficiency standards for oil-and-gas/petrochemical, pulp-and-paper, grain and rock processing, other harsh environments</em></h3>
<p>Siemens announced the immediate availability of the SIMOTICS SD200 severe-duty motor in frame size 440 as its latest offering in the low-voltage SIMOTICS motor family.</p>
<p>Providing high productivity and energy-efficient operation in all torque ranges, these new cast-iron NEMA motors are built to power pumps, fans, compressors, hoists, winders and similar equipment in harsh environments. With a three-year warranty, the SD200 motors offer 75-800 hp output and feature 444-5013 cast-iron frames for operation in 460V and 575V ranges. They meet or exceed NEMA Premium® MG1 Table 12-12 efficiencies. A wide selection of options is offered, including IP56 ingress protection, encoders, brakes, and blowers plus others to suit the applications presented.</p>
<p>On these motors, the frame, end-shields, fan guard and easy-access, diagonally split, oversized terminal box are all cast-iron. Complementing this construction are zinc-plated hardware, epoxy paint and stainless-steel nameplates for long life and easy identification in the field. A unique offset rotor bar provides improved efficiency, while larger bars and end rings reduce resistance. Each die-cast aluminum rotor assembly is dynamically balanced for extended bearing life and includes a high-strength C1045 carbon steel shaft for maximum performance. Premium C5-grade steel laminations and copper magnet wire are standard.</p>
<p>For insulation, the Class-H non-hygroscopic system with NEMA Class B temperature rise provides an extra margin of thermal life. The insulation system meets or exceeds NEMA MG1 2014 Part 31, making these motors suitable for variable speed drives in constant torque (4:1) and variable torque (20:1). All windings are tested for Corona Inception Voltage (CIV).</p>
<p>The Siemens Product Manager for Low-Voltage NEMA Motors, Oscar Palafox, explains, “One of the features of the SD200 is its flexibility in the field, as the motor can be switched from F1 to F2 and F3 orientation with ease. Plus, the safety features on this new line are unmatched by competition. Full H-Class conformity provides winding protection, while the swivel hooks are a significant improvement over eyehooks for handling of these heavy units. In addition, the unique Siemens composite insulation on the SD200 is a cost-saver over the ceramic bearing alternative with ten times the resistance of other solutions in the market. Finally, the NEMA Premium® efficiency is a guarantee of long performance life with very tight deviation of losses. Shaft current remains more consistent for better uptime.” Palafox further notes this new line affords users Division II, Class 1 (gas) and Class 2 (dust) protection.</p>
<p>Siemens SIMOTICS SD200 frame size 440 low-voltage, severe-duty AC motors will be introduced at EASA 2021. They are designed for use in the harsh environments of oil-and-gas/petrochemical, grain, rock product, plus food-and-beverage and other markets with Division II, Class 1 and 2 conditions present.</p>

These issues, in addition to geopolitical tensions, are deeply complex and cannot be addressed on an individual scale.</p>
<p>In addition, the energy industry faces major challenges pertaining to communication given that the workforce and equipment operate in remote and harsh environments. With assets and personnel continuously on the move in areas that lack traditional methods of connectivity, it can be difficult to monitor productivity and access field data. This, in turn, can impact other critical events or environmental compliance standards, as well as emergency response safeguards.</p>
<p>While individual businesses cannot strengthen the global supply chain independently, solve the labor shortage, or reconcile international relations, fortunately, the latter set of issues related to connectivity can be ameliorated. Where terrestrial cellular coverage falls short, satellite connectivity prevails. With satellite coverage, continuous connectivity can be ensured for remote asset tracking, asset management, secure communications at exploration sites, monitoring transmission and deliveries tracked by internet of things (IoT) infrastructure, and worker safety for improved business efficiencies.</p>
<p>Given the current strain on the energy industry, it’s imperative to save costs and increase productivity whenever possible. Certain challenges may be uncontrollable, but issues such as visibility, connectivity, and communication can undoubtedly be addressed and doing so will result in significant benefits for business owners, employees, and customers alike.</p>
<h2>Satellite IoT in Action</h2>
<p>Satellite IoT refers to the use of satellite communication networks and services to connect terrestrial IoT sensors and IoT end-nodes to a server. IoT enables interconnectivity between objects such that they can communicate and relay orders without requiring human-to-human or even human-to-computer interaction. The type of information relayed depends upon the specific IoT sensor, which is determined based on the use case.</p>
<p>As a concept, it can be challenging to grasp how revolutionary this technology can be for the energy sector. While continuous, dependable connectivity and asset management sound useful, how exactly is the value realized? There are an infinite number of ways that satellite IoT can be implemented; the limit of its applications is constrained only by the limit of the imagination.</p>
<p>Take cathodic protection (CP), for example. CP systems keep corrosion under control, thus protecting the millions of miles of metallic pipelines that carry petroleum products, natural gas, water, and wastewater throughout our communities. However, to continue to be effective, these systems must eventually be replaced. Traditionally, site inspections by pipeline personnel are required multiple times per year. With thousands of miles of pipelines running through remote territory, a significant amount of time must be devoted to staffing time and travel costs.</p>
<p>However, with satellite IoT, CP systems can be monitored wirelessly for pipeline operators around the world. The satellite IoT device provides continuous performance monitoring with automated alerts to unusual conditions or failure, and the ability to test remotely. Furthermore, technicians can use any web-enabled device to access a cloud platform to see where CP systems are operating normally and to download performance data, generate reports, and remotely modify device configurations.</p>
<p>Another prevalent application for satellite IoT in the energy industry is oil tank monitoring. To maintain oil production, the fluid levels in storage tanks at a drill site require regular monitoring. Legacy measurement systems are complicated, costly to install and calibrate, and often require personnel to check gauges by hand. Tank monitoring is increasingly being handled remotely, but for drilling rigs on the move, cellular connection is unreliable.</p>
<p>Satellite enabled IoT tools can illuminate data on tank levels including GPS coordinates, allowing drilling companies and their vendors to see all tanks, establish automatic alerts when levels are low, and automate dispatch of supply trucks to refill the tanks. Smart data processing on edge devices allows for limited data transmission when tanks require no action and the condensation of data into short messages, therefore reducing transmission costs. Drilling companies can effectively save thousands of unnecessary hours and ensure that fluids are always available to support uninterrupted operation.</p>
<p>These examples are just a sample of the litany of ways in which satellite IoT technology can be leveraged throughout the energy sector.</p>
<h2>Continuous Connectivity Meets Customization</h2>
<p>To truly grasp the dependability of satellite connectivity, it’s important to understand that this technology is relied upon to save thousands of lives each year. For personnel working in remote locations, satellite messengers can be used to share information on location and status in case of an emergency. If thousands are willing to utilize satellite communications when their lives are at stake, every business owner should have peace of mind when it comes to using the same technology to monitor and manage their equipment, fleets, or assets.</p>
<p>In addition to reliability, satellite IoT solutions can be customized to suit specific needs or use cases. Embedded satellite IoT chips can integrate with a wide range of hardware based on application needs. However, the true breadth of customization is realized on the software end of IoT.</p>
<p>With certain devices and enablement platforms, instead of custom-coding for specific device hardware, developers can, utilizing a low-code platform, hardware abstraction, and unified APIs, seamlessly interface between application and capabilities of the satellite IoT edge device. By developing artificial intelligence (AI)-driven applications that send smart data from the edge, energy businesses can effectively reduce the transmission fee associated with sending data from the IoT device to the endpoint, or server, and improve operational performance.</p>
<p>Flexibility is also a useful attribute of satellite IoT solutions. Say, for instance, an organization is looking to expand its IoT capabilities, additional sensors can deliver valuable new capabilities quickly and easily by using Bluetooth connectivity. Furthermore, if a business would benefit from machine learning and executable files to improve the performance of systems in the field, the right IoT partner will have the storage and processing power necessary to run applications at the edge, and the platform to simplify configuration, application development, and device management.</p>
<p>As society continues to advance along with technology, many are looking to renewable energy options in addition to traditional energy sources like oil and gas. These energy production methods are also often located in remote areas and would benefit from satellite IoT as much as any other organization that has people and assets located in isolated areas.</p>
<p>The beauty of satellite IoT is that it will work for you, regardless of your specific needs or geographical location. For those who operate in remote areas that stand to gain from improved visibility, reliability, reduced cost, and repurposed employee hours, consider satellite IoT to help meet the current demands of the energy sector.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(Hartville, OH) Renewable Lubricants presents patented, ultimately biodegradable Bio-E.P.<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Gear Oils which are ideal lubricating spur, helical, bevel, and worm gears subject to heavy loading or shock loading in heavy-duty applications.  These environmentally friendly formulations meet or exceed the U.S. Steel 224, AGMA 9005-E02, DIN 51517 Part 3, ISO 12925-1 CKD, David Brown DB S1.53.101 and Cincinnati Machine performance requirements.  In addition to performance comparable to or exceeding synthetics, these bio-based products help companies achieve their sustainability goals.  Formulated from renewable agricultural bio-based resources, they are non-toxic, zinc-free formulations which contain no heavy metals. Direct replacement products are available for Industrial Grade, ISO grade, and AGMA products.  Bio-E.P.<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Gear Oils are an economical choice where leakage or contaminations are more prominent or on equipment with more frequent oil change intervals.</p>
<p>Energy conserving Stabilized BOBS technology combined with synthetic base stocks and exceptional E.P./anti-wear technology results in a super high viscosity index (VI) product with long life heat stability.  This provides longer gear life protection through extremely high film strength during elevated operating temperatures.  Rapid demulsification allows users to drain water from the system quickly to prevent corrosion, protect components, and extend oil life.</p>
<p>Bio-E.P. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Gear Oils meet the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 2013 Vessel General Permit (VGP) guidelines for Environmentally Acceptable Lubricants (EALs) and should be used where low toxicity, biodegradability, and non-bioaccumulation properties are required.  In addition to being safer for the environment, they are safer for employees.  It exceeds the acute toxicity (LC-50/EC-50{1000 ppm) criteria adopted by the US Fish and Wildlife Service and the US EPA.</p>
<p>Renewable Lubricants, Inc. began as a research and development company in 1991, developing high performance products that would directly replace petroleum-based products.  Starting from a single corn-based engine oil developed in the inventor’s garage, the company now offers more than 250 products and has over 100 worldwide patents.  They manufacture their products as environmentally friendly as possible without sacrificing performance.  For more information on Renewable Lubricants, Inc., contact Benjamin Garmier at (330) 877-9982, or <a href="mailto:info@RenewableLube.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">info@RenewableLube.com</a>, or visit <a href="https://www.renewablelube.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.RenewableLube.com</a>.</p>

<p><em><strong>You must be a power guy or gal to consider a generating station an attraction. If you are, you won’t find a better place to visit than the Cane Island Power Park. The facility is in a picturesque location and maintained like a gem. It’s also the winner of a 2022 POWER Top Plant award.</strong></em></p>
<p>If you have kids, you’ve probably vacationed in Central Florida, or at least considered it. That’s because <a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Walt Disney World</a> is located there, as are at least a dozen other theme parks and attractions, many of which are tied to Disney, <a href="https://www.universalorlando.com/web/en/us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Universal Studios</a>, and <a href="https://seaworld.com/orlando/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SeaWorld</a>.</p>
<p>While Orlando is the city with the most name recognition in the region, the Orlando metropolitan area also includes other municipalities, including Kissimmee, Leesburg, Mount Dora, and Winter Park. What most visitors don’t realize is that all the cities mentioned are members of the <a href="https://fmpa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Florida Municipal Power Agency (FMPA)</a>, a wholesale power agency owned by 31 municipal electric utilities in Florida, representing nearly 2.7 million Floridians. FMPA provides some or all electricity to 24 municipal electric utilities located throughout the state.</p>
<h2>A Reliable and Consistent Power Source</h2>
<p>One of the power plants that supplies electricity to FMPA’s members is Cane Island Power Park, which, incidentally, is located on a site that butts up against Disney property. Cane Island is jointly owned by FMPA and the Kissimmee Utility Authority (KUA). The facility has four natural gas–fueled units. Units 1, 2, and 3 are split 50/50 between the two organizations, and Unit 4 is wholly owned by FMPA. KUA manages the day-to-day operations.</p>
<p>All of the Cane Island gas turbines are GE models. Unit 1 is a 40-MW simple cycle LM6000 that is operated for peaking purposes. Units 2, 3, and 4 are all combined-cycle units. Unit 2 features a 7EA gas turbine and can generate 125 MW. Units 3 and 4 are both 7FA gas turbines with capacities of 260 MW and 315 MW, respectively, following major upgrades to Unit 3 completed earlier this year.</p>
<p>Cane Island Power Park came online in 1994 and has consistently exceeded expectations for reliability and efficiency. In 2021, for example, the station generated more than 3.8 TWh of electricity, and boasted record-breaking continuous runs on Unit 3 (234 days) and Unit 4 (185 days). Unit 3’s streak was the longest continuous run ever in FMPA’s fleet.</p>
<p>Cane Island has also had excellent availability as demonstrated by the units’ equivalent availability factors (EAFs). In 2021, Units 2, 3, and 4 logged EAFs of 95.6%, 96.8%, and 93.4%, respectively. Units 2 and 3 had no forced outages during the year, and Unit 2 had a 100% EAF during peak summer months.</p>
<h2>Maintenance Is Key</h2>
<p>One reason the plant operates so well is the staff’s keen focus on maintaining equipment properly. In Fall 2021, the station undertook a major maintenance and upgrade project on Unit 3.</p>
<p>“Upgrades and regular maintenance are typically based on the unit’s operating hours. This was the second quadruple major outage and first major performance upgrade on Unit 3 since it came online in 2001,” Jay Butters, plant manager and assistant vice president of power supply at KUA told <em>POWER</em>. “The unit is designed for 30 years of service; however, we regularly maintain our power plants and expect many more years of service from the unit.”</p>
<p>“The Unit 3 upgrade was done in partnership with General Electric through a service agreement,” Ken Rutter, COO of FMPA, told <em>POWER</em>. “We have had a longstanding relationship with GE, and their knowledge and expertise has been a big part of the unit’s record-setting performance over time.”</p>
<p>The upgrades were a major undertaking, so collaboration between FMPA, KUA, and GE was important. “There were 150 workers onsite at the height of the project,” Bill Mangan, operations and maintenance manager at Cane Island Power Park, told <em>POWER</em>. “Most of the project team were from GE’s skilled labor workforce, so they were already familiar with the equipment and work that was needed on the unit.”</p>
<p>The Unit 3 maintenance outage included work around both the gas and steam turbines. The gas turbine received a new turbine rotor, compressor blading, and hot gas path components, including combustion equipment, turbine blades, shrouds, and buckets. The steam turbine was completely disassembled to replace bearings and install new components. The team also replaced and refurbished the stationary components on the steam turbine generator and completely refurbished the rotating field (Figure 1).</p>

<h2>Early, Yet Flexible, Planning</h2>
<p>Planning for the Unit 3 upgrades began immediately following the last major outage on the unit in 2012. That allowed plenty of time to prepare, including buying supplies and equipment well in advance. The foresight allowed FMPA and KUA to avoid some of the supply chain issues that other utilities are facing today. However, the team didn’t sidestep all delivery issues.</p>
<p>“The team did a remarkable job handling the challenges,” said Butters. “When the new gas turbine was installed, we ran the unit in simple cycle operation until the steam turbine and generator were available. This enabled us to generate some of the power that was being purchased on the open market, due to the outage,” he said.</p>
<p>“Unit 3 is a workhorse in FMPA’s fleet, so it was important for us to complete the maintenance and upgrades as soon as possible while operating our other units as normal,” Rutter explained.</p>
<p>“Our team created an outage excellence procedure to conduct critical path work first and to maintain efficiency,” said Mangan. “There were multiple aspects of the project happening at the same time, so it took a lot of coordination and communication to ensure work being done met expectations.”</p>
<p>“By working with GE, we were able to complete the upgrades and fully bring the unit back online before the peak summer months. This was particularly important because of the record-high temperatures in June,” Rutter said. “Since coming back online, Unit 3 has operated continuously and increased its efficiency by nearly 2%. We expect the unit to continue running until its next planned outage in late November.”</p>
<p>In addition to increasing efficiency, the upgrades to the gas and steam turbines also increased Unit 3’s output by 12 MW. FMPA and KUA estimate that this will enable the facility to power an additional 8,400 homes, which is important in Central Florida, where the population is surging. Another upgrade the group is planning includes Unit 3’s overfiring operation during peak demand times. The upgraded software will increase the unit’s output when overfiring, allowing it to power even more homes.</p>

<h2>Focus on Safety and Equipment Preservation</h2>
<p>Butters noted that Cane Island has a great safety record. “We are proud to report there were no injuries during the project,” he said. “Every person working at the plant goes through a safety briefing about work protocols, what to do in case of an emergency, and more. Subcontractors also must wear a permit holder with instructions to help them understand their surroundings and the lockout process. And before each outage, we send our safety procedures to contractors and subcontractors, so they know what to expect when they arrive on site.”</p>
<p>In the hot, humid, swampy environment around Cane Island, rust can be a problem. As part of the Unit 3 project, the team decided to try a film-forming ammonia coating, which was new to them. The product—designed to prevent corrosion—was applied to all exposed steel during maintenance. “This had great success,” Mangan said. Upgrades to Cane Island Units 2 and 4 are planned for later this year, and FMPA will also upgrade Treasure Coast Energy Center Unit 1 in Fort Pierce, Florida. “We plan to use the film-forming ammonia during the upgrades on all units,” Mangan said.</p>
<p>Upgrades to Unit 3 began in Fall 2021. The gas turbine was available in early January 2022. The unit was brought back online for full commercial operation in Spring 2022.</p>
<p>“It was challenging to perform a major overhaul of Unit 3, while keeping our other baseload units operating as normal. Unit 3 is one of three baseload power plants that provides affordable, reliable, and clean power to 24 Florida cities, so the team had to keep the power flowing to our customers. Completing these upgrades and increasing output on Unit 3 will enable us to do that well into the future,” said Rutter.</p>

<p>Boilers come in many shapes and sizes, and they can be used for a variety of purposes. Whether for utility, institutional, or industrial steam applications, there is usually a rental unit that can be brought in to meet a facility’s needs.</p>
<p>“Rental boiler systems provide an ideal solution for meeting a temporary steam supply requirement. This can be due to the interruption of normal boiler operation caused by a system failure, the need to meet a peak or seasonal demand, the desire to initiate operations before a permanent steam plant is in operation, or to provide an alternate steam supply during scheduled maintenance periods,” Tim McBride, rental sales manager for <a href="https://www.nationwideboiler.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nationwide Boiler Inc.</a>, told <em>POWER</em>.</p>
<p>Fremont, California–based <a href="https://www.nationwideboiler.com/mobile-boiler-rentals.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nationwide Boiler</a> is one of several rental boiler suppliers (Figure 1). Among its competitors are Thomasville, Georgia–based <a href="https://cleaverbrooks.com/boiler-rentals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cleaver-Brooks</a>; Wheeling, Illinois–headquartered <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/indeck-power-equipment-company/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indeck Power Equipment Co.</a>; Collinsville, Oklahoma–headquartered <a href="https://victoryenergy.com/rental-boilers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Victory Energy</a>; and others.

<h2>Why a Rental?</h2>
<p>Ned Kaled, director of <a href="https://victoryenergy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Victory Energy’s</a> Aftermarket Business, offered <em>POWER</em> some examples of why customers come to him looking for a rental boiler. “One, they are planning to receive a new unit, and they want to carry out the demolition process on the older unit without impacting their production,” he said. Victory Energy has supported biofuel, medical, refining, paper, and food processing facilities, among others, with those kinds of needs.</p>
<p>Kaled said another reason might be when a facility has a spike in steam demand and wants to evaluate if the additional steam demand will be required on an ongoing basis. “They provision a rental unit to allow them time to carry out the analysis,” he said.</p>
<p>A third reason is when a facility needs to perform work on installed equipment. “If they’re doing their annual maintenance and would like to make sure that while the unit they have is down, and going through inspections that are mandated by the regulatory entities and the insurance companies, a rental is a very good system to back up their demand on steam,” said Kaled.</p>
<p>Victory Energy designs, manufactures, and supplies trailer-mounted boiler systems ranging in size from 40,000 lb/hr to 150,000 lb/hr with operating pressures from 100 psi to 750 psi. The units are mounted on customized, highway-legal trailers, making delivery and setup a less troublesome task.</p>
<p>“Our mobile boilers can be dispatched directly to a job site, quickly and safely. We provide 24-hour phone service and 24-hour boiler-technician dispatch. Upon arrival, there are no cranes or rigging required; no need for special handling to safely load or unload boilers at either the job site or the storage yard,” Victory Energy says. “Because our mobile boiler systems are engineered and manufactured from the ground up, we essentially ensure the delivered package is self-contained, with single point connections to an electrical power source, fuel and water supplies, steam header, and even blowdown/drains that are required for operation.”</p>
<p>McBride said Nationwide Boiler offers rental boilers that supply 1,000 lb/hr up to 200,000 lb/hr in a single package, with options for both saturated and superheat steam supply. With more than 100 boilers in their fleet, multiple boilers can be combined to meet steam requirements of more than 500,000 lb/hr (Figure 2). “The majority of our users are industrial production facilities such as oil refineries, chemical facilities, food processing plants, and pulp and paper plants. The loss of production drives the economics of renting a boiler,” he said.</p>

<h2>Logistics</h2>
<p>Lead times vary depending on the urgency of a customer’s situation. It can take a day or two in emergency cases to months when a steam outage or maintenance period is scheduled well in advance. “Generally, the larger the boiler, the longer the shipping time, mainly due to highway permitting requirements,” McBride said. “Our largest boilers (200,000 lb/hr) are delivered by rail, which can take up to two months for scheduling and delivery. We’ve also used the Antonov AN-124 giant cargo plane [Figure 3] for rental boiler delivery around the world when they needed it quickly.”</p>

<p>Kaled said the market for rental boilers has been booming. Victory Energy has numerous rental units in its fleet, but Kaled said they were at 100% utilization in early September 2022. “We’re going through a very-high-demand period for the rentals,” Kaled said. “And so, when it comes to lead time, we can accommodate customers that depend on Victory. As the manufacturer, we have produced additional rental units to deploy in the fleet and to grow our assets, so we can support the unplanned demands of our customers.”</p>
<p>Victory Energy has been able to slash lead times by 30% to 40% compared to industry averages, according to Kaled, because it is vertically integrated and manages its supply chain well. “Our leadership—and particularly our president and CEO—is laser focused on making sure that we control our manufacturing needs,” Kaled said. “We have been able to reduce the lead time very significantly.”</p>
<p>Concerning delivery, Kaled said Victory Energy’s logistics department is very experienced and capable. “We plan and execute all the logistics for our customers, whenever they ask us to handle any particular part of the task,” he said. There can be a variety of rules and regulations when moving equipment through different states, so not only having experts in charge, but also one’s own trucks and trailers to support boiler deliveries, can really pay dividends.</p>
<p>“Our logistics team is very knowledgeable and knows exactly how to get the asset to the customer in the safest and the soonest time possible,” Kaled said. “I mean, this is our daily life. That’s exactly what we do—make sure that we are well-coordinated with the customer and orchestrating the entire delivery process.”</p>
<h2>Early Planning Helps</h2>
<p>Yet, the farther ahead a facility can plan to fill temporary steam needs, the better. “The best time to plan for installing a temporary steam plant is before the need actually arises,” said McBride. “Most of the issues we typically overcome are related to the installation and utilities connections. We did a study several years ago and 75% of the time to get a rental boiler up and running was not due to the delivery of the unit but the time for tie-in requirements to the plant such as running steam lines, electrical stations, and fuel supply.”</p>
<p>McBride said Nationwide Boiler’s customers typically handle the installation of rental boiler equipment, so it’s important that they understand what they’re renting. “We provide complete engineering drawing packages that list measurements and connection sizes so that they have this information ahead of time,” McBride explained. “The commissioning of a rental boiler is no different than your permanent boiler. Units need to be fully checked for safe and proper operation, and combustion tuning done including emissions testing (for permitting requirements). It’s usually a two- to five-day process in most cases.”</p>
<p>Many rental boiler suppliers also have the capability to provide mobile water treatment systems designed to operate with their boilers. Victory Energy and Nationwide, for example, offer optional systems that can include deaerators, water softeners, boiler feedwater pumps, and a chemical treatment system, all pre-piped and wired within a standard 53-foot over-the-road enclosed trailer.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best advice, however, is to do plenty of research before committing to a boiler rental. McBride concluded: “It’s important for customers to do their homework to ensure that they are renting from a reputable company that maintains a fleet of purpose-built rental boiler equipment. They should also be aware of all customer responsibilities, which typically includes the installation and disassembly of rental equipment, acquisition of air and operating permits, and proper water treatment throughout the duration of the rental to avoid damage and ensure efficient operation. Customers are also expected to carry insurance that covers the full value of rental boiler equipment. Lastly, rental boilers are really not plug and play, there’s a lot more to installing and operating a boiler than say, a generator. We like to make sure our customers are not surprised by what’s involved with renting a boiler, because nobody likes surprises, especially when it involves more time and money.”</p>

The reality is that removing the global economy’s reliance on carbon is incredibly complex, and there’s no single “magic fix” that will propel us into a sustainable future. Instead, we must address the problem at every stage of the industrial value chain.</p>
<p>Only a combination of approaches applied across the value chain will help industries, including utilities and power generators, reach ambitious sustainability targets. The most effective solutions will be those that continue to create commercial value for the industries and businesses that employ them, while naturally driving the transition toward a decarbonized economy. This is especially true of industries where producing significant carbon emissions is common, such as electricity generation, manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, and heating.</p>
<p>Furthermore, even the most dedicated steps in one area will be ineffective unless paired with similar efforts up and down the chain. For example, electrification—the move away from fossil fuels to produce energy—can go a lot further in reducing emissions when partnered with low- or zero-carbon electricity generation and energy-efficient processes.</p>
<h2>Shifting the Grid to Renewables</h2>
<p>Electricity generation is at the root of almost every modern industrial value chain, yet conventional approaches based on fossil fuels are associated with high carbon emissions. For electrification efforts down the chain to be truly sustainable, they must be powered by electricity from renewable sources.</p>

</table>
<p>Renewable sources of power, such as onshore and offshore wind, solar (Figure 1), and hydroelectric, are already responsible for a significant and constantly increasing proportion of electricity generation. However, in almost every country, the grid is supported by more predictable, consistent, and high-carbon power sources, such as burning coal or natural gas. A challenge for decarbonization remains ensuring a steady supply of baseload power, while at the same time addressing the issue of emissions reduction.</p>
<p>Carbon-intensive generation already are being phased out, and more will need to be phased out in the decades ahead. But as noted, this presents a challenge for the grid. Renewable power sources are generally more variable and weather-dependent than traditional sources, and this can result in grid instability. Technologies such as battery storage and synchronous condensers can help maintain the balance, but grids are complex systems, and applying these technologies correctly is not always simple.</p>
<p>To develop a better understanding of real-world renewable power grid stability, especially in an era of decarbonization, ABB has recently partnered with the Fraunhofer Institute for Wind Energy Systems (IWES) in Germany to start building the world’s largest mobile grid simulator. This simulator will begin operating in 2023, and enable the testing of grid stability under different conditions. Efforts like this will be required worldwide to better understand the consequences of using more energy from renewable resources, and to overcome any associated issues with the decarbonization of the grid.</p>
<h2>Effective Electrification</h2>
<p>Many types of carbon-intensive equipment can—relatively easily—be substituted with electrical alternatives. In some cases, electrical solutions can even be direct drop-in replacements.</p>
<p>For example, the mining industry is extremely energy-intensive, and a large percentage of the emissions are associated with transportation. In India, one of the largest private steel companies used diesel-powered trucks to transport iron ore from the mine, with vehicles making nearly 3,000 trips back and forth each year. This was inefficient in terms of both energy use and employee time, so the company sought a better option.</p>
<p>The company replaced its trucks with a 24-kilometer-long electric conveyor system. Since it is powered by electricity rather than diesel fuel, this solution has the potential to reduce emissions significantly, as well as providing numerous other benefits. Unlike trucks, this system isn’t prone to road slippage or vehicle breakdowns, and it significantly cuts the inbound logistics costs. The conveyor is also significantly safer than driving ore to the site—there have been zero road accidents since the conveyor system was put in place.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Danish port city of Esbjerg turned to electrification for a sustainable solution for its heating needs. While burning carbon may be an efficient way to heat homes and businesses, it is a major source of emissions. As a sustainable alternative, ABB recently delivered the integrated electrical infrastructure for a seawater heat pump that uses a combination of electric motors, drives, and other technology to provide clean heating. When completed, the system will provide “green heat” to more than 100,000 inhabitants of Esbjerg, significantly reducing the city’s emissions. It’s a model already in use by utilities and power companies seeking to decarbonize their operations.</p>
<p>In the India and Denmark examples, electrification provided motivation to address the problem with a clean sheet design, which is significantly better than the prior solution in terms of convenience and safety, as well as efficiency and sustainability. Electric solutions in many cases are also more reliable and easier to maintain than older alternatives.</p>
<h2>Efficiency and Sustainability</h2>
<p>Simply adopting electrification to address decarbonization isn’t enough: the solutions must also be efficient. The International Energy Agency (IEA) describes efficiency as the “first fuel” in the world’s journey to net zero, noting that converting existing machinery to run more efficiently is an effective way to cut emissions without sacrificing economic viability.</p>

</table>
<p>Electric motors are an excellent example of the potential for technological improvements to drive efficiency (Figure 2). These motors are present in virtually every industry, and certainly in power generation, powering compressors, fans, conveyors, pumps, and other machinery. They are so common that industrial electric motors alone are responsible for 45% of global energy consumption—much of it from carbon-intensive sources.</p>
<p>Many of the millions of older motors running right now around the world are less efficient than the latest designs, and wasting energy as a result. Simply by dropping in modern motors combined with variable-speed drives, or VSDs, which enable a motor to precisely match its speed to the speed required for the task it is completing, industries (and some power plants) could cut their power use by as much as a quarter.</p>
<p>This is partly due to the counterintuitive relationship between speed and power consumption: a motor running at half speed consumes only one-eighth of the energy used by one running at full speed. For this reason, even small reductions in speed can yield significant power savings. Despite this, only about 23% of the world’s industrial motors are currently paired with a VSD, leaving them running at full speed constantly and consuming more energy than is necessary.</p>

</table>
<p>In addition to efficiency improvements in the machinery itself, data and digital services can enable entire facilities (Figure 3) to operate more efficiently. Sensors on modern equipment can detect deviations in temperature, vibration, and countless other variables to identify areas where electricity is going to waste, and operators can then address these issues. These improvements have made a marked difference in operations and maintenance at power generation stations, among other facilities.</p>
<p>For example, decision-makers at a paper mill in Munksund, Sweden, were looking to improve the facility’s efficiency, but with 2,400 motors onsite, it was difficult to know which to replace. The company is committed to efficient energy use, so many motors were already up to high efficiency standards.</p>
<p>To identify the motors that would benefit most from replacement with a modern motor-drive package, the facility contracted ABB to carry out a comprehensive condition monitoring project. Engineers securely collected data on temperature, operational patterns, stress levels, and other variables to identify long-term trends in performance. With these insights, the engineers identified motors and drives in need of replacement, recommended specific models to replace them with, and calculated exactly how much energy they would save each year.</p>
<h2>Future Applications</h2>
<p>There are many steps that can be taken immediately, using today’s technology, to concretely address carbon emissions. However, given that net-zero is a goal in the future, it’s also worth considering the role that emerging technologies can play.</p>
<p>For example, hydrogen is just starting to see serious adoption as an alternative, zero-carbon fuel. Hydrogen is ideally suited to applications where electrification technology is not yet capable of meeting specific requirements, such as aviation. The keys to success in building a hydrogen economy will be managing production, distribution, and utilization efficiently through digitalized infrastructure.</p>
<p>Another technology that may play a major role in decarbonization is carbon capture and storage technology. While the field has not yet reached maturity, it continues to advance at an impressive pace. Recent advances in enhanced hydrocarbon recovery and direct-air capture of carbon dioxide, for instance, suggest that the technology is within reach. Once captured, carbon can be safely sequestered or used productively, such as in the production of alternative fuels and building materials. Power generators have the opportunity to be at the forefront of this movement.</p>
<p>Carbon is entwined tightly with almost every type of industrial process in every country around the world. Untangling this connection and replacing carbon with cleaner alternatives is a challenge, but utilities and power generators already have proven they’re up to the task. Advances in technology mean that maintaining commercial value is not an obstacle to reaching net zero.</p>

Over half of all lift trucks sold in the U.S. in 2018 already were electric, and the pace of transitioning to electric motive power has only accelerated in the last years.</p>
<p>Switching from liquid petroleum gas (LPG) to electric forklifts (Figure 1) is bringing tangible and proven benefits to all operations using lift trucks, including lower operational and total ownership costs, and safer, cleaner, and quieter conditions at workplaces. Lithium forklift battery technology made this switch viable for many heavy applications. In this article, we demonstrate how to correctly calculate the lithium forklift battery amp-hour (Ah) capacity for switching to electric forklifts.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_178779" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-178779" style="width: 480px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-178779" src="https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/onecharge-lithium-battery-hyster-electric-forklift.jpeg" alt="OneCharge-lithium-battery-hyster-electric-forklift" width="480" height="483" srcset="https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/onecharge-lithium-battery-hyster-electric-forklift.jpeg 480w, https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/onecharge-lithium-battery-hyster-electric-forklift-298x300.jpeg 298w, https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/onecharge-lithium-battery-hyster-electric-forklift-150x150.jpeg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-178779" class="wp-caption-text"><em>1.

<h2>Handling Power-Hungry Applications</h2>
<p>Internal combustion engine (ICE) lift trucks are still used by many companies today, partly because of the inertia of business-as-usual, and partly because the old-generation electric trucks did not allow the switch. Inefficient lead-acid forklift batteries have inherent limitations and cannot support applications with a high energy throughput, such as paper and packaging, lumber, and metals, especially in extremely low or high temperatures and outdoor conditions. Long travel distances, driving up ramps, heavy loads, high lift heights, and the use of powered attachments, such as paper clamps, all put extra pressure on the power source.</p>
<p>Lithium batteries remove these barriers to going electric and reduce operational costs and pollution. Lithium battery packs can store a lot more energy than a lead-acid battery in the same size battery compartment and can be quickly opportunity-charged during breaks and lunches to last through multiple shifts every day. The FROST Series battery operates in extreme temperatures without any significant loss in capacity thanks to a built-in heater and insulation.</p>
<h2>LPG Versus Electric Forklifts</h2>
<p>LPG forklifts are, by and large, comparable to diesel- and gasoline-powered lift trucks. LPG engines produce lower noise and air pollution levels at workplaces, and they also cost less to fill the tank than other ICEs that use diesel or gas.</p>
<p>However, when compared to electric-powered lift trucks, they are much more expensive to operate and maintain. The environmental benefits of electric power are also obvious. So, it is just a matter of time before nearly all ICE-powered trucks will transition to electric. As a matter of fact, the timing is already set in some states. California, for instance, will not allow the sales of new forklifts unless they are zero-emission forklifts starting in 2026.</p>
<p>Lithium solutions have the highest return on investment (ROI) of the advanced motive power sources commercialized today. The advance of lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) batteries in the material handling industry followed the mass adoption of these batteries in electric buses and passenger electric vehicles (EVs), this technology was already tried and tested by the time it was introduced to material handling equipment (MHE).</p>
<p>Apart from safety and environmental benefits, lithium batteries offer users a significant improvement in forklift performance: faster travel and lift speeds, less downtime, and no acid spills or fumes. But what really made the adoption of lithium technology possible is the proven ROI of lithium forklift batteries, which comes with significant savings on energy, labor, and infrastructure costs.</p>
<h2>Total Cost of Ownership</h2>
<p>Below you see a real-life example of a calculation of the total cost of ownership for LPG and lithium-powered forklifts. These calculations are based on five electric and five LPG lift trucks of the same brand, operating five days a week, three shifts per day, for five years. The cycle life of lithium batteries lasts up to 10 years, depending on the application and usage profile. This value is not negligible. To simplify the analysis, we did not take into account the residual value of the trucks and batteries.</p>
<p>The upfront cost of the equipment is higher with the electric lift trucks, but the savings over the five years are very substantial. With lithium-powered forklifts, this company saves on labor and maintenance. The rule of thumb is that an electric forklift requires one-third the maintenance of an ICE engine forklift.</p>
<p>However, the real difference is in the cost of electricity compared to the cost of propane fuel. The company ended up paying 10 times less for electric power than what it would have spent on propane. The prices of electricity and LPG vary across the states, but the difference is dramatic everywhere. The total savings with lithium-battery electric forklifts, in this case, amounts to about 56%, or $400,000.</p>

Total cost of ownership calculation: LPG versus lithium electric forklift. Source: OneCharge</em></figcaption></figure></p>
<h2>Calculating Battery Ah Capacity</h2>
<p>In the above example, we have juxtaposed similar forklift models of the same brand powered by LPG and electric engines. To run this analysis correctly we needed to compare apples to apples, that is, the engines also needed to be similar in terms of energy and power output. Here’s how the engineers at OneCharge calculate the parameters of a lithium battery for LPG to electric forklift transition.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_178785" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-178785" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-178785 size-full" src="https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/lpg-vs-lithium.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="345" srcset="https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/lpg-vs-lithium.jpeg 640w, https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/lpg-vs-lithium-300x162.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-178785" class="wp-caption-text"><em>2. LPG tank vs. lithium battery. Courtesy: OneCharge</em></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>We typically recommend that our customers go with a higher voltage battery option to have “more gas in the tank” to be ready for an unexpected extra hour of operation or a missed charging event. Besides, it is a good practice to keep the battery state of charge above 50% to prolong its cycle life, so the extra Ah capacity always helps.</p>
<p>Many companies today still stick to their old propane lifts because of inertia, long-standing business relations with local MHE dealers, and lack of knowledge of the new lithium technology. Typically, you’ll find LPG forklifts in outdoor operations in the lumber, paper, and recycling industries. Traditional business and financing terms for leasing material handling equipment may also prevent customers from transitioning to electric forklifts. For example, if a third-party logistics company has a three-year contract, the utilization of higher-priced electric forklifts will still be far from 100% by the end of the lease term, and the market is not yet offering a standard way to recover the high residual value of lithium batteries after just three years of use.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that these issues will be resolved in the very near future. Even though a less effective technology can be hard to switch from (remember your VHS cassette recorder?) the current social consensus on the urgency of energy transition from fossil fuels, coupled with the economic benefits, will push many industries to accelerate the adoption of lithium battery-powered electric equipment.</p>
<p>We are starting to see the adoption of lithium batteries outside of MHE in heavier machinery. Successful commercial projects include electric cranes and excavators in the construction industry, and locomotive engines in trains. Experiments are underway in marine transportation, and aviation is next in line. The future of powered equipment is electric.</p>

<p>Again, this year, Experience POWER will be co-located with the Distributed Energy Conference (DEC) and HydrogeNext, giving attendees the opportunity to learn from and network with trailblazers from the power industry, who are leading the way in the world’s energy transition. These <a href="https://www.experience-power.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three events cover the full energy value chain for the power industry</a>, delivering the best content and covering cutting-edge technology that is important to power professionals. The events will be held at the <a href="https://www.experience-power.com/hotel-travel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gaylord Rockies Resort and Convention Center</a> in Aurora, Colorado, Oct. 3–6, 2022.</p>
<h2>Experience POWER in Its 24th Year</h2>
<p>“Our flagship event Experience POWER was created by electricity generators, for electricity generators, and we have continued to grow our content to cover the pressing topics and industry changes as they come,” said Kayla Sparks, group show director for the Energy and Engineering Group with Access Intelligence. “This means our brand and our events have continued to grow, which is why we now also offer the co-located Distributed Energy Conference and HydrogeNext, which provide the opportunity to dive deeper into advancing sectors impacting your plant.”</p>
<p>“The three events provide a broad range of great educational content, from sessions focused on central power stations and grid infrastructure to distributed energy resources and the hydrogen economy,” said <em>POWER</em> Executive Editor Aaron Larson. “I’m particularly interested in hearing what the keynote speakers have to share, and I’m also excited to be moderating an Executive Roundtable session at the event.”</p>
<p>Among the keynote presenters will be Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association President and CEO Duane Highley, and Robert Chapman, senior vice president of Energy Delivery and Customer Solutions, and Chief Sustainability Officer with the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI). Highley is expected to talk about his group’s “Responsible Energy Plan,” which will likely include details on how Tri-State is eliminating emissions at facilities in New Mexico and Colorado, while adding more than 1 GW of wind and solar power to its resource mix. Chapman is expected to cover topics such as natural gas infrastructure, low-carbon fuels, electrification, technology adoption, and much more.</p>
<h2>DEC Connects the Entire Distributed Generation Ecosystem</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.distributedenergyconference.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DEC brings together utility-scale electricity providers with other power generators</a>, including commercial and industrial facilities, educational institutions, cooperatives, and private enterprise to dive into real-life applications, project planning, and the business and financial aspects of distributed generation. On the agenda the first day is a session looking at how electric vehicles (EVs) are literally “driving” distributed power generation, helping decarbonize the transportation sector. Jim Auld of Florida Power &amp; Light, Pam Frank of ChargEVC, and Ann Moore of OSIsoft will participate in that discussion, focusing on how the growth of EVs will impact the future of the power grid.</p>
<p>“Utilities are studying how increased power demand to charge EVs will affect power loads. Consumers are weighing the pros and cons of buying EVs. Commercial building owners, industrial sites, and even residential home builders are recognizing the need to accommodate charging infrastructure as part of their future plans,” said Darrell Proctor, senior associate editor with <em>POWER</em>. “I’ll be there too, offering insights from <em>POWER </em>into how the electrification of transportation is changing the energy landscape.”</p>

<h2>HydrogeNext: An Event for the Emerging H<sub>2</sub> Economy</h2>
<p>Hydrogen has been at the center of much enthusiastic discussion, due to its potential to help many industrial sectors realize their decarbonization goals and provide a sustainable source of energy. But what does the “hydrogen economy” really mean for power companies, and chemical processors—who are among the world’s largest consumers of hydrogen?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.experience-power.com/hydrogenext/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HydrogeNext is the one event</a> designed to answer that question. It covers the full hydrogen energy value chain from production to distribution and end-use, bringing together power generation and chemical process industry professionals to collaborate and learn about the fast-paced advances being made toward a hydrogen economy.</p>
<p>“In October, industry leaders at the cutting edge of the energy and manufacturing sectors will convene in Denver at the HydrogeNext conference to map out their hydrogen and decarbonization goals through collaborative discussions on hydrogen storage, safety and regulatory considerations, the electrolysis evolution, practical success stories, and much more,” said Mary Page Bailey, senior associate editor with <em>Chemical Engineering</em>. “No matter your plant’s place in the hydrogen value chain, HydrogeNext will provide connections with key technology and business experts to provide insights about the quickly accelerating hydrogen economy.”</p>
