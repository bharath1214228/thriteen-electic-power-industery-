<p><strong>San Diego, Oct. 20, 2022</strong> – Today, General Atomics (GA) announced a new concept for a fusion pilot plant (FPP) to deliver clean, safe, and economically viable fusion energy.</p>
<p>GA’s FPP concept utilizes a steady-state, compact advanced tokamak design approach, where the fusion plasma is maintained for long periods of time to maximize efficiency, reduce maintenance costs, and increase the lifetime of the facility. <strong>To learn more about the concept, please visit: </strong><strong><a href="https://www.ga.com/fusion-pilot-plant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.ga.com/fusion-pilot-plant</a>. </strong></p>
<p>“Excitement for fusion energy is at an all-time high, with historic interest from private industry and government,”<strong> said Dr. Anantha Krishnan, Senior Vice President of the General Atomics Energy Group. </strong>“We look forward to working with our partners to make our vision for economic fusion energy a reality. Now is the time for fusion, and General Atomics plans to lead the way.”</p>
<p>Fusion is the process that powers the stars and offers the potential for nearly limitless clean energy. It occurs when two light nuclei combine to form a new one, releasing vast amounts of energy. Researchers can achieve fusion using a &#8220;tokamak,&#8221; which uses heat and electromagnets to create the necessary heat and pressure to force the nuclei to fuse.</p>
<figure id="attachment_179310" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179310" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-179310 size-large" src="https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/general-atomics-fusion-pilot-1024x576.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/general-atomics-fusion-pilot-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/general-atomics-fusion-pilot-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/general-atomics-fusion-pilot-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/general-atomics-fusion-pilot.jpeg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-179310" class="wp-caption-text"><em>A render of the General Atomics Fusion Pilot Plant (interior).

<p>Fueled primarily by isotopes of hydrogen found in seawater and capable of generating its own fuel during operation, the GA FPP would provide baseload energy without any harmful emissions or long-lived waste. Capable of operating around the clock, commercialized fusion power plants would provide sustainable, carbon-free firm energy for generations.</p>
<p>“The General Atomics Fusion Pilot Plant is a revolutionary step forward for commercializing fusion energy,” <strong>said Dr. Wayne Solomon, Vice President of Magnetic Fusion Energy at General Atomics.</strong> “Our practical approach to a FPP is the culmination of more than six decades of investments in fusion research and development, the experience we have gained from operating the DIII-D National Fusion Facility on behalf of the U.S. Department of Energy, and the hard work of countless dedicated individuals. This is a truly exciting step towards realizing fusion energy.”</p>
<p>“General Atomics has a long and storied history of being at the forefront of fusion innovations,” <strong>said Dr. Brian Grierson, Director of the Fusion Pilot Plant Hub at General Atomics.</strong> “We are proud to be a world leader in plasma theory and modeling, advanced materials engineering, and other areas necessary for commercializing fusion. We intend to bring the full strength of our institutional expertise to this effort as we advance our vision for fusion energy.”</p>
<p>The GA FPP concept capitalizes on GA innovations and advancements in fusion technology. The facility would utilize GA’s proprietary Fusion Synthesis Engine (FUSE) to enable engineers, physicists, and operators to rapidly perform a broad range of studies and continuously optimize the power plant for maximum efficiency. GA has also developed an advanced modular concept (GAMBL) for the breeding blanket which is a critical component (of the fusion power facility) that breeds tritium, a fusion energy fuel source, to make the fusion fuel cycle self-sufficient.</p>
<p>General Atomics recently announced a <a href="https://www.ga.com/ga-and-savannah-river-national-lab-team-up-on-fusion-pilot-plant" target="_blank" rel="noopener">joint research partnership with Savannah River National Laboratory</a> to address challenges of tritium handling as part of the U.S. Department of Energy’s Innovation Network for Fusion Energy (INFUSE) grant program.</p>
<p>With extensive experience in at-scale manufacturing and established relationships across industry and government, GA is actively engaging with leading institutions around the world to pursue the most rapid, economically practical path to fusion energy—including universities, national laboratories, government, and industry. GA is working with a wide range of energy stakeholders to ensure that fusion is deployed in a way that meets the needs of local and global communities.</p>
<p><strong><em>About General Atomics:</em></strong><em> Since the dawn of the atomic age, General Atomics innovations have advanced the state of the art across the full spectrum of science and technology – from nuclear energy and defense to medicine and high-performance computing. Behind a talented global team of scientists, engineers, and professionals, GA’s unique experience and capabilities continue to deliver safe, sustainable, economical, and innovative solutions to meet growing global demands.</em></p>

<p>Ontario Power Generation (OPG) and Czech Republic-based ČEZ are collaborating to advance deployment of nuclear technology, including small modular reactors (SMRs). The companies said they signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on Oct. 11, with an aim to “reduce financial, technical and schedule risk to both parties on their respective future projects.”</p>
<p>OPG is Ontario’s largest electricity generator. The company has 75 generating stations in the province with a combined capacity of more than 18 GW. In addition to 66 hydroelectric facilities, its fleet includes two nuclear stations—the 3.5-GW Darlington facility and the 3.1-GW Pickering station (Figure 1). OPG says nuclear power provides about 60% of Ontario’s power today.</p>
<figure id="attachment_179016" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179016" style="width: 700px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-179016" src="https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/pickering-nuclear-power-plant-opg.jpeg" alt="" width="700" height="466" srcset="https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/pickering-nuclear-power-plant-opg.jpeg 700w, https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/pickering-nuclear-power-plant-opg-300x200.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-179016" class="wp-caption-text"><em>1. Pickering Nuclear Generating Station is a power plant located on the north shore of Lake Ontario. It consists of eight CANDU reactors. Since 2003, two of the units have been defueled, while the other six units remain operational. Courtesy: OPG</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>“Ontario Power Generation is a world-class nuclear operator, with decades of experience in providing safe, clean, reliable nuclear power,” OPG President and CEO Ken Hartwick said in a statement. “Working together with entities like ČEZ, we can leverage our combined experience to develop and build the new technology needed to power the future and meet decarbonization goals.”</p>
<p>ČEZ is one of Europe’s largest energy companies. Both OPG and ČEZ have committed to achieving net zero goals by 2040, and they believe advanced reactor technology can help in that mission.</p>
<h2>Darlington SMR</h2>
<p>Under the MOU, OPG and ČEZ will share information related to the deployment of new nuclear projects. OPG has said new nuclear generation, including SMRs, is “an essential part of the electricity mix needed to decarbonize the energy sector and broader economy.” OPG is in the process of deploying an SMR at its Darlington site and has already received approval of an Environmental Assessment.</p>
<p>In December 2021, OPG said it would work with GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy on the Darlington SMR project. GE Hitachi’s BWRX-300 (Figure 2) is a 300-MWe water-cooled, natural circulation SMR with passive safety systems. It is the 10th evolution of GE’s boiling water reactor (BWR). The company says the BWRX-300 represents the simplest and most innovative BWR design since it began developing nuclear reactors in 1955.</p>

<p>On March 10 this year, OPG announced it had awarded a $32 million contract to E.S. Fox Limited for the first phase of site preparation and support infrastructure for the Darlington SMR project. Among the infrastructure work expected to be completed under the contract is bringing water, electrical power, information technology, and roads to the site. The Darlington SMR is expected to be operational by the end of this decade.</p>
<h2>ČEZ’s Nuclear Fleet</h2>
<p>ČEZ is no stranger to nuclear power either. It currently operates two nuclear power plants (NPPs) in the Czech Republic. The four-unit Dukovany site (Figure 3) was the first NPP built on Czech territory, and, according to the company, it is “one of the largest, most reliable, and economically advantageous energy sources” in ČEZ’s fleet. Dukovany is located 30 kilometers (km) southeast of Třebíč. It produces about 20% of the total electricity consumption in the Czech Republic.</p>
<figure id="attachment_179011" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179011" style="width: 700px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-179011" src="https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/dukovany-npp.jpeg" alt="" width="700" height="472" srcset="https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/dukovany-npp.jpeg 1024w, https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/dukovany-npp-300x202.jpeg 300w, https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/dukovany-npp-768x518.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-179011" class="wp-caption-text"><em>3. The Dukovany Nuclear Power Plant, with an installed capacity of 2,040 MW, is the second-largest nuclear power plant in the Czech Republic. Courtesy: ČEZ</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Dukovany plant has four VVER 440 model V 213 pressurized water reactors (PWRs). The individual units were put into operation between 1985 and 1987. The original total installed electrical capacity was 1,760 MW, but output has been gradually increased through turbine upgrades, efficiency programs, and technical improvements. Today, the power plant has an installed capacity of 2,040 MW.</p>
<p>ČEZ also operates the dual-unit Temelin NPP, which is situated about 24 km from the South Bohemian capital České Budějovice. Temelin has two VVER 1000 Type V 320 PWRs. The units entered operation in 2000 and 2003, respectively. The station generates roughly the same electricity annually as the Dukovany plant.</p>
<h2>A Partnership with Potential</h2>
<p>Like OPG, ČEZ has taken first steps toward expanding its nuclear fleet at both Temelin and Dukovany. “As a company, we are focused on developing new energy solutions and technologies,” Tomáš Pleskac, member of the Board of Directors and chief of the New Energy Division with ČEZ, said in a statement. “We are preparing for the construction of a new nuclear unit in Dukovany and the upcoming allocation of space at Temelín, where the first SMR could be built in the first half of the next decade. The collaboration with OPG is therefore, for us, a logical step forward.”</p>
<p>“Ontario is proud to lead the way on clean nuclear technologies,” Ontario’s Energy Minister Todd Smith, said in a statement. “With our robust nuclear supply chain and talented workforce, we are ready to support the global deployment of our nuclear expertise that will help reduce emissions while delivering energy security to the world.”</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s2">China’s State Council has approved two AP1000 nuclear reactor units for </span><span class="s1">State Power Investment Corp.’s (SPIC’s) Lianjiang Nuclear Power Plant in Zhanjiang, Guangdong province, reactor technology supplier Westinghouse said on Oct. 12. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If built, the units will become ninth and tenth reactors based on Westinghouse’s Generation III+ advanced reactor technology in China. Four AP1000 units are already currently operating in China: <a href="https://www.powermag.com/worlds-first-ap1000-nuclear-reactor-reaches-full-power/"><span class="s3">Sanmen 1 and 2 in Zhejiang province</span></a> and <a href="https://www.powermag.com/how-an-ap1000-plant-is-changing-the-nuclear-power-paradigm-through-district-heating-desalination/"><span class="s4">Haiyang 1 and 2 in </span><span class="s5">Shandong province.</span></a></span><span class="s5"> The four reactors were commissioned in 2018.</span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s5">Another four CAP1000 reactors—China’s licensed adaptation of the AP1000—are under construction at the Sanmen and Haiyang plants. Sanmen 3 and 4. </span><span class="s6">China National Nuclear Corp. (CNNC) kicked off construction </span><span class="s5">of the second phase at Sanmen in <a href="https://en.cnnc.com.cn/2022-06/29/c_785202.htm"><span class="s1">June 2022</span></a>, while </span><span class="s1">Shanghai Nuclear Engineering Research and Design Institute (SNERDI), a SPIC affiliate, poured first concrete for Haiyang’s second phase in July 2022. The State Council approved the two projects <a href="https://info.westinghousenuclear.com/news/four-westinghouse-ap1000-reactors-in-china"><span class="s5">in April</span></a></span><span class="s5">. </span><span class="s1">By Sept. 25, SNERDI, a general contractor for both projects, reported it had separately hoisted in place containment vessels at <a href="https://www.snerdi.com.cn/newsdetail?id=8210"><span class="s7">Haiyang 3</span></a> and <a href="https://www.snerdi.com.cn/newsdetail?id=8200"><span class="s7">Sanmen 3</span></a>. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">SNERDI is also building CAP1000s at Lianjiang 1 and 2. The company on Sept. 28 announced it began excavation for the Lianjiang plant’s first phase. The site is designed to host a total of six 1.2-GW reactors, said <a href="https://www.snerdi.com.cn/newsdetail?id=8198"><span class="s4">SNERDI</span></a>.</span></p>
<h2>Speeding Toward &#8216;Nth-of-a-Kind&#8217;</h2>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Westinghouse in a statement congratulated SPIC on adding the AP1000-derived plants to its growing fleet. It said the <a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D5VZ8EYuUUqU%26utm_source%3DPress%2BRelease%26utm_medium%3DWEC_Press%2BRelease%26utm_campaign%3DWEC_AP1000%26utm_id%3DPG_WEC&amp;esheet=52943645&amp;newsitemid=20221012006094&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=AP1000&amp;index=1&amp;md5=90a059fe16f7f9474a9844d51669236a"><span class="s8">AP1000</span></a> plant “is the only operating Generation III+ advanced reactor with fully passive safety systems, modular design, and has the smallest footprint per MWe on the market.” The reactors at Sanmen and Haiyang “utilize the most advanced, proven technology and have set industry records with their outstanding startup, availability, and operational performance. <a href="https://www.powermag.com/how-an-ap1000-plant-is-changing-the-nuclear-power-paradigm-through-district-heating-desalination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One unit</a> at the Haiyang site is generating both electricity and steam for district heating,” it noted. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">China’s AP1000 <a href="https://www.powermag.com/major-milestones-for-the-ap1000-reactor/"><span class="s4">derivatives stem from technology transfer </span></a>agreements between China’s </span><span class="s5">State Nuclear Power Technology Corp. (SNPTC) </span><span class="s1">and Westinghouse to standardize the reactor technology and enable domestic production of components. In April, as the State Council approved the second phases at Sanmen and Haiyang, Westinghouse said its partnership with SPIC—which was created through the 2015 merger of</span><span class="s9"> China Power Investment Corporation and SNTPC—takes “full advantage of the AP1000’s plant’s outstanding performance in the four existing operating units.” </span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s9">A key benefit has been to accelerate serial building of the technology, Westinghouse noted. “[</span><span class="s1">T]hrough our successful partnership with [SPIC] in China, we expect to achieve an AP1000 plant ‘nth-of-a-kind’ project with the construction cost and schedule of these next four units validating the recent Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) report conclusions regarding the attractive cost and schedule for future AP1000 units.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s10">On Wednesday, </span><span class="s1">Westinghouse President and CEO Patrick Fragman said the company is “proud to be a part of this 15-year nuclear energy cooperation program and delivering on our commitment to enable a fleet of AP1000 units to power a carbon-zero future for China.”</span></p>
<h2>Future Prospects in China, Europe, and Maybe Even the U.S.</h2>
<p class="p9"><span class="s4">Along with China’s AP1000 builds, two AP1000 units are currently being completed at the Vogtle site in the U.S. in </span><span class="s1">n Waynesboro, Georgia. Southern Co., which owns 45.7% of that project through its subsidiary Georgia Power, says <a href="https://www.southerncompany.com/innovation/vogtle-3-and-4.html"><span class="s11">significant progress continues to be made</span></a> at the Vogtle 3 &amp; 4 nuclear expansion site. Direct construction at Unit 3 is approximately 99% complete, and the total project is approximately 96% complete. Georgia Power currently projects a Unit 3 in-service date in either the fourth quarter of 2022 or first quarter 2023. Unit 4 is projected to be complete in either the third or fourth quarter of 2023. Vogtle 3, in August, notably,<a href="https://www.powermag.com/vogtle-3-gets-nrcs-approval-to-begin-operation-in-significant-regulatory-milestone-for-u-s-nuclear-industry/"><span class="s11"> received the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s green light to load fuel and begin the operation of the unit</span></a>. </span><span class="s12">Vogtle 3 is the first reactor in the nation to reach the milestone as part of the regulator’s Part 52 combined license process.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s5">Westinghouse</span><span class="s1"> AP1000 technology also <a href="https://www.powermag.com/poland-secures-nuscale-smr-as-urgency-for-nuclear-energy-ramps-up-across-central-eastern-europe/"><span class="s4">has been selected for nine units in Ukraine</span></a> and is under consideration at multiple sites in other countries in Central and Eastern Europe and the United Kingdom. Westinghouse on Wednesday also said the reactor technology is under consideration in the U.S.</span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">Westinghouse’s AP1000 developments are being closely watched, given that the technology is currently the legendary American company’s flagship large-scale nuclear offering. While delays and setbacks at the company’s U.S. AP1000 projects <a href="https://www.powermag.com/how-westinghouse-symbol-of-u-s-nuclear-power-collapsed/"><span class="s10">crippled the reactor</span></a> vendor, and even sent it into bankruptcy in 2017, the company appears to have reemerged as a solid contender in the burgeoning market for nuclear power, which is increasingly being seen as integral for decarbonization. </span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">Earlier this week,  </span><span class="s10">a </span><span class="s1">consortium comprised of Brookfield Renewable Partners, together with its institutional partners, and Cameco Corp. <a href="https://www.powermag.com/nuclear-giant-westinghouse-acquired-by-renewable-power-company-and-uranium-fuel-supplier/"><span class="s5">agreed to acquire</span></a> Westinghouse from Brookfield Business Partners (BBU). The $8 billion deal is expected to be finalized in the second half of 2023, subject to customary closing conditions and approvals.</span></p>

<p>A consortium comprised of Brookfield Renewable Partners, together with its institutional partners, and Cameco Corp. announced on Oct. 11 an agreement to acquire Westinghouse Electric Co. from Brookfield Business Partners (BBU). The deal has a total enterprise value of about $8 billion, including proceeds from the disposition of a non-core asset expected to be received prior to closing the transaction. The deal is expected to be finalized in the second half of 2023, subject to customary closing conditions and approvals.</p>
<p>Westinghouse has a long and storied history in the energy industry dating back more than a century. The company was a pioneer in the nuclear power industry, and it continues to be a major player in the sector today.</p>
<p>Westinghouse has four key business lines. Operating Plant Services provides recurring services for outages and maintenance, engineering solutions, and replacement components and parts. Nuclear Fuel offers long-term contracting for the manufacturing and installation of fuel assemblies and other ancillary equipment across multiple light water reactor technologies, including as the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) for approximately half the nuclear plants worldwide. Energy Systems designs, engineers, and supports the development of new nuclear reactors. Environmental Services provides services to government and commercial customers that support nuclear sustainability, environmental stewardship, and remediation.</p>
<p>“This is the start of an exciting new chapter for the Westinghouse team and for nuclear power,” Patrick Fragman, president and CEO of Westinghouse, said in a statement. “We are grateful to BBU for its stewardship and investments that have strengthened Westinghouse’s position in the nuclear power industry, and more broadly in the clean power world, for the long-term. Now we are proud to join Brookfield Renewable and Cameco, reaffirming the important role played by Westinghouse and nuclear power in enabling the world’s clean energy transition and energy security goals.”</p>
<p>Brookfield Renewable operates one of the world’s largest publicly traded, pure-play renewable power platforms. Its portfolio consists of hydroelectric, wind, solar, and storage facilities in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia, and totals approximately 24 GW of installed capacity with approximately 100 GW more in its development pipeline. Cameco, meanwhile, is one of the largest global providers of uranium fuel. It claims to have a competitive advantage based on its “controlling ownership of the world’s largest high-grade reserves and low-cost operations.” Its headquarters are in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada.</p>
<p>After giving effect to the transaction, Brookfield Renewable and other affiliates of Brookfield Asset Management Inc. will own a 51% interest in Westinghouse and Cameco will own 49%. Brookfield Renewable said it is “pursuing this opportunity through the Brookfield Global Transition Fund I, which is the largest fund in the world focused on the clean energy transition.” </p>
<p>Westinghouse was acquired by BBU out of bankruptcy in 2018. In early July this year, Westinghouse announced organizational and structural changes designed “to further drive the company’s growth strategy and enhance customer engagement.” Notably, the company created a dedicated Global Markets organization and realigned its portfolio of installed fleet services into two global business units with responsibility for Operating Plant Services and Nuclear Fuel. Several personnel changes were also made in leadership positions at the time.</p>
<p>“These are the right steps at the right time for Westinghouse,” Fragman said in a statement released on July 5. “We are bolstering our global approach to meet the extraordinary market opportunities and enhance our responsiveness to our customers.”</p>
<p>BBU claims Westinghouse’s profitability nearly doubled under its ownership. “Today the business is ideally positioned to benefit from strong industry tailwinds driven by increased recognition of nuclear power as a reliable source of clean energy to achieve global decarbonization goals,” it said.</p>
<p>“We have significantly enhanced the business’ operations over the past four years, increasing its margins and strengthening its global leadership position. Westinghouse is an exceptionally well-run business today and has a great future,” Cyrus Madon, CEO of BBU, said in a statement. When combined with distributions received to date, BBU said it expects proceeds to be approximately six times its invested capital—roughly a $4.5 billion total profit.</p>
<p>The consortium, however, believes Westinghouse’s business is poised for further growth. “Westinghouse is well positioned to increase business in its core fuel and services segments, execute on the growing pipeline for extending and uprating nuclear power plants, and service the rising demand for new utility-scale and modular baseload nuclear power generation,” the group said.</p>
<p>Westinghouse provides services to about half of the nuclear power generation sector. The company has significant intellectual property and a specialized workforce of about 9,000 employees capable of operating in markets around the world. Approximately 85% of Westinghouse’s revenue has come from long-term contracted or highly recurring customer service provisions, with a nearly 100% customer retention rate, according to the consortium. The group said given Westinghouse’s comprehensive services offerings and position as an OEM, it has “stability in all macroeconomic environments.”</p>
<p>In a statement, Tim Gitzel, president and CEO of Cameco, said, “We’re witnessing some of the best market fundamentals we’ve ever seen in the nuclear energy sector. As one of the few forms of electricity generation capable of safely, reliably and affordably producing emissions-free, baseload power, nuclear energy is becoming increasingly important in a world that prioritizes electrification, decarbonization and energy security. The opportunity to partner with Brookfield Renewable, a leader in the clean-energy space, to acquire Westinghouse is expected to create a platform for growth across the nuclear value chain. Coupled with our more than 30-year proven track record of providing secure and reliable fuel supplies to a global customer base, this transaction fits perfectly within Cameco’s strategy and is expected to increase our ability to meet the growing needs of existing and new customers at a time when origin and security of supply is of significant concern. At the same time, we expect the recurring demand for Westinghouse’s operating plant services and nuclear fuel will generate a strong revenue stream and add stable cash flow to complement Cameco’s existing uranium and fuel services business.”</p>
<p>Said Connor Teskey, CEO of Brookfield Renewable, “Westinghouse has successfully refocused on providing core services to the nuclear industry and is ready for the next phase of growth. The business aligns well with our existing portfolio, delivering highly contracted and dependable revenue by serving customers who operate critical clean energy assets. Partnering with Cameco brings deep nuclear sector expertise, alongside our knowledge of energy markets and global customer base, to form a formidable champion for nuclear power. We see significant potential to grow the business and deliver on broader growth in the nuclear power sector through our strategic partnership with Cameco.”</p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s5">UKAEA, </span><span class="s6">which carries out fusion energy research on behalf of the UK government, </span><span class="s5">said the prototype will be &#8220;designed and constructed at the coal plant site t</span><span class="s1">o demonstrate the ability to put net electricity on the grid.” It could “also pave the way to enable future commercial fusion energy plants to be commissioned and constructed,” the agency said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Site selection for the STEP nuclear prototype plant, which could have many features of a fully operational power station, represents a marked milestone for fusion development and puts it closer to fruition. The UKAEA’s ambitions to build a STEP prototype have been much-watched, given that it is considered a pioneering project in the race to develop </span><span class="s6">fusion energy, an energy resource that essentially replicates the process which powers the sun.</span></p>
<h2>A Government-Backed Fusion Prototype</h2>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Fusion energy (sometimes called nuclear fusion, though this is discouraged to avoid confusion with nuclear fission) harvests the large amount of energy released when light atomic nuclei (such as hydrogen) fuse together to form heavier ones (such as helium). To enable this “fusion,” fuel is heated to very high temperatures forming a plasma in which fusion reactions take place.</span></p>

<td style="background-color: #eeeeee;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">For an in-depth look at how fusion energy works and major advances in recent years, see <em>POWER</em>’s June 2020 feature, “<a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.powermag.com/fusion-energy-is-coming-and-maybe-sooner-than-you-think/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-feathr-click-track="true"><strong>Fusion Energy Is Coming, and Maybe Sooner Than You Think</strong></a><strong>.”</strong></span></td>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Experts have long-lauded its possibilities as the perfect energy resource: Not only could it provide a virtually limitless of highly concentrated, baseload energy, generating that energy produces no greenhouse gas emissions or long-lived radioactive waste. And, the risk of accidents with a fusion plant is limited: <a href="https://www.powermag.com/fusion-energy-is-coming-and-maybe-sooner-than-you-think/"><span class="s7">if containment is lost, the fusion reaction simply stops</span></a>.  </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s8">The STEP prototype will be a compact spherical tokamak (a magnetic confinement device</span><span class="s1">)</span><span class="s8">, much smaller than other fusion energy programs, such as the <a href="https://www.iter.org/"><span class="s9">International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER)</span></a></span><span class="s1">. “Most fusion reactors are built in the shape of a ring doughnut while the spherical plant is shaped more like a cored apple. This shape improves efficiency in the magnetic field and potentially reduces the plant’s cost,” UKAEA said.</span></p>

<p class="p6"><span class="s10">Backed with </span><span class="s1">£220 million of government funding for the first phase of STEP, UKAEA expects to produce a “concept design” by 2024.

<h2>Coal Plant Picked After Rigorous Assessment</h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s5">UKAEA on Thursday said the government picked the West Burton site “</span><span class="s1">following a rigorous assessment process over almost two years.”</span> <span class="s1">The agency said it long-listed 15 locations for the STEP prototype following an open call for sites in December 2020. In March 2021, it </span><span class="s10">wrapped up collecting public opinion on where to site the pioneering project. </span><span class="s1">It then narrowed its selections to five after assessments in October 2021. A second round of assessments in the spring resulted in UKAEA making its final recommendations to the Secretary of State in May 2022, it said. </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s3">The West Burton site on the River Trent near </span><span class="s1"> <a href="https://mapcarta.com/Gainsborough"><span class="s14">Gainsborough, Lincolnshire</span></a>, <a href="https://mapcarta.com/England"><span class="s14">England</span></a> houses two power plants. West Burton A, owned by EDF, is a coal-fired power station commissioned in 1966, and West Burton B is the site of a combined cycle gas turbine plant that was commissioned in 2013. EDF sold West Burton B to EIG, a global energy project investor, in September 2021. While EDF had mulled the closure of West Burton A in September 2022, the utility this June <a href="https://www.edfenergy.com/media-centre/news-releases/west-burton-closure-update"><span class="s15">announced it would keep the two-unit plant open</span></a> until March 2023. </span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s16">“The other sites shortlisted to host STEP were Ardeer, North Ayrshire; Moorside, Cumbria; Goole, East Yorkshire; and Severn Edge, Gloucestershire,” the government said.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> “Selecting the location of the STEP prototype plant is a huge, visible moment in the challenging and long-term endeavor of bringing fusion energy to the grid,” said Professor Ian Chapman, UKAEA Chief Executive. “West Burton is a natural fit for the STEP programme with a rich industrial heritage now being developed and repurposed for a low carbon future. It really is ‘from fossil fuels to fusion,’ “ he said. </span></p>

<p>There have been historic initiatives within the U.S. to create a sustainable energy economy and to address major environmental concerns created by fossil fuels. The Inflation Reduction Act contains $369 billion in climate and energy provisions, which will have a meaningful impact on climate change. Meanwhile, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law seeks to remedy environmental issues caused by inadequate regulation within the oil and gas industry.</p>
<p>The push for the use of renewable energy in the U.S. has created a legislative imbalance across the country. With any new initiative, legislation to regulate industry can be slow and ad hoc. Non-renewable energy, such as nuclear energy, coal, and oil, have been used for centuries, and the industry has become one of the most highly regulated. However, legislation for the decommissioning of plants utilizing these forms of energy has proven to be abysmal.</p>
<h2>Nuclear and Coal Power Plant Decommissioning</h2>
<p>The decommissioning process occurs at the end of plant life after operations cease. The process of decommissioning for non-renewable energy varies, with nuclear plants being the most highly regulated. The regulation for the decommissioning of a nuclear plant is outlined by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and may occur using one of three strategies. These are DECON, immediate dismantling soon after the plant closes; SAFSTOR, often considered “deferred dismantling,” which involves maintaining and monitoring the facility to allow radioactivity to decay over decades; or ENTOMB, contaminants are permanently encased onsite in a material such as concrete. Additionally, to ensure that the decommissioning takes place, the NRC ensures that licensees of sites have sufficient funds for decommissioning with a reporting mechanism in place every two years. Regulation of nuclear sites is crucial, as there could be catastrophic implications for the people and environment, if performed inadequately.</p>
<p>Decommissioning of coal-fired power plants is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Coal-fired power plant decommissioning is not as stringent as a nuclear plant, and involves cleanup and waste removal, remediation, and redevelopment. Many of these plants are retired but have yet to be cleaned up, remediated, and redeveloped because of the sheer cost of carrying out the venture. Instead, many entities seek to sell these plants as-is to an investor with deep pockets that has the wherewithal to remediate and redevelop them in accordance with EPA guidelines.</p>
<p>The funding for coal plant decommissioning costs is largely based on whether the facility is located in a regulated or deregulated state. In deregulated states, such as Pennsylvania, there is no state or federal protection to ensure that there is adequate funding for decommissioning. The cost of decommissioning is included in the cost of doing business. Coal plants can sit for years after shutdown without remediation, such as the 236-acre Hatsfield Ferry Plant, retired in 2013 but demolition and restoration will not be completed until 2024. However, in regulated markets across the U.S., decommissioning is paid by the ratepayer after the utility company provides cost estimates on a recurring basis and regulators approve the expenses. Delays in decommissioning can have negative impacts on the environment and community as a plant sits idle.</p>
<h2>Funding Problems for Oil and Gas Site Decommissioning</h2>
<p>Oil and gas decommissioning, similar to coal-fired plants, is also plagued with abandoned wells that were improperly done, exposing residents to potential pollution that can leach into the soil. Decommissioning of oil wells involves dismantling the facility, plugging and abandoning the well, and restoring the site to its original condition. According to an investigation done by Reuters in 2020, America has more than 3.2 million unplugged abandoned wells, with Pennsylvania having more than 200,000 of those wells.</p>
<p>Federal regulation only governs 10% of the drilling that takes place within the U.S., according to the American Petroleum Institute, while the other 90% takes place on privately owned land governed by state laws and regulations. Many state regulations have proven to be woefully inadequate to cover the costs associated with decommissioning. For example, Texas administrative code requires only a $250,000 performance bond, letter of credit, or cash for 100 or more wells, while the average cost to plug a well ranges from $20,000 to $145,000, according to a Government Accountability Office report focused on the risks associated with insufficient bonds to reclaim wells.</p>
<p>Oil and gas companies have successfully escaped liability due to insufficient bonds, and many at the end of retirement of facilities are bankrupt with the state being left with the financial burden. According to Haynes and Boone LLP, there were 61 oil field service companies that filed for bankruptcy in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Taxpayers have been left bearing the decommissioning liability, while oil and gas entities have eked out all profits from the wells. This resulted in lobbying efforts to have the federal government step in and remedy the situation by providing funding. In January 2022, the Department of the Interior received $1.5 billion through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to commence the plugging and capping of abandoned oil and gas wells, and awarded $560 million to 24 states, including West Virginia and Mississippi, for plugging of wells in August 2022.</p>
<h2>Modern Approach to Decommissioning</h2>
<p>In the age of renewable energy, one could only hope that legislators have learned from the horrors experienced in the decommissioning of non-renewable sites. Many first-generation solar and wind facilities are coming to an end with the average life of panels and turbines ranging from 25 years to 35 years. Like fossil fuels, there is ad hoc legislation relating to the decommissioning of renewable facilities.</p>
<p>Decommissioning of solar panels and wind turbines includes the removal of all panels or turbines, structures, foundations, fencing, roads, and restoring the property to the previous condition. Unlike fossil fuels, remediation is not considered in decommissioning, as many of the panels are recyclable and there is only an issue of environmental contamination if high quantities of lead and cadmium are present.</p>
<p>The federal government, through the Bureau of Land Management, and 19 states have decommissioning legislation for renewable facilities. Pennsylvania is in the process of debating decommissioning legislation. The lack of decommissioning regulations in most states is surprising, as the federal government had to rescue states to plug oil and gas wells. Without adequate decommissioning policies, landowners—mainly in rural areas—could be left with the financial burden of removing the panels.</p>
<p>Most decommissioning legislation has the lessee of the solar farm delivering evidence of financial assurance that it will be able to complete the decommissioning of the site after the useful life of the equipment. The assurance is usually based on the total acreage being used for the solar or wind facility, less the salvaged value.</p>
<p>Although finalizing regulations for decommissioning of renewable energy sites is slow, many of these facilities are not yet retired. Therefore, states have the ability to enact legislation prior to the retirement of wind and solar farms, leading many states to avoid the failures of non-renewable legislation.</p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The alliance, which stems from an agreement unveiled on Oct. 3 and previous joint work between the two companies, will “serve as a springboard to accelerate LFR technology development,” said Dr. Rita Baranwal, Westinghouse’s chief technology officer. “We are developing an economically competitive, versatile and sustainable nuclear power plant which will be deployed to accommodate the needs of diverse communities and evolving energy markets, including district heating, hydrogen generation, and water desalination,” she said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The two companies have worked together for over 40 years to develop light water reactor (LWR) technology through AP600 and AP1000 plant projects. The companies have also separately invested in LFR technology over the last 20 years.</span></p>
<h2>LFRs: A Lesser-Known Fast Reactor Type</h2>
<p class="p5"><span class="s4">LFRs are <a href="https://www.powermag.com/rapid-advancements-for-fast-reactors/"><span class="s3">fast neutron reactor concepts</span></a> cooled with molten lead or lead-based alloys (</span><span class="s5">most commonly the eutectic mixture of lead and bismuth</span><span class="s4">). That offers an advantage over sodium-cooled fast reactors (SFRs)—the <a href="https://www.powermag.com/rapid-advancements-for-fast-reactors/"><span class="s3">most mature of all fast reactor concepts</span></a>—because lead </span><span class="s6">is a moderately active metal and </span><span class="s4">does not rapidly react with water and air like sodium.</span><span class="s3"> However, LFRs operate at high temperatures and near atmospheric pressure, conditions enabled because of the very high boiling point of the coolant (up to 1,743C) and its very low partial pressure. But compared to SFRs, which have been widely demonstrated and <a href="https://www.powermag.com/tag/bn-800/"><span class="s7">are even in commercial operation</span></a>, LFR concepts have remained constrained by research challenges. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;In the case of the LFR, these challenges include those related to the high melting point of lead; its opacity; coolant mass as a result of its high density; and the potential for corrosion when the coolant is in contact with structural steels,&#8221; the <a href="https://www.gen-4.org/gif/jcms/c_42149/lead-cooled-fast-reactor-lfr">Gen IV International Forum notes</a>.</p>
<p>However, the forum also notes that the LFR &#8220;has excellent materials management capabilities since it operates in the fast-neutron spectrum and uses a closed fuel cycle for efficient conversion of fertile uranium. It can also be used as a burner to consume actinides from spent LWR fuel and as a burner/breeder with thorium matrices. An important feature of the LFR is the enhanced safety that results from the choice of molten lead as a relatively inert and low-pressure coolant. In terms of sustainability, lead is abundant and hence available, even in case of deployment of a large number of reactors.&#8221;</p>
<p>It adds: &#8220;More importantly, as with other fast systems, fuel sustainability is greatly enhanced by the conversion capabilities of the LFR fuel cycle. Because they incorporate a liquid coolant with a very high margin to boiling and benign interaction with air or water, LFR concepts offer substantial potential in terms of safety, design simplification, proliferation resistance and the resulting economic performance.&#8221;</p>
<h2>LFR Interest Growing</h2>
<p class="p5"><span class="s8">Ansaldo led one of the world’s first LFR projects in 2006, the European Lead-Cooled System (ELSY), with a large consortium of other European organizations. The group sought to demonstrate the feasibility of a competitive and safe LFR. While the ELSY project ended in 2010, LFR development continued under the </span><span class="s9">Lead-cooled European Advanced Demonstration Reactor (LEADER) program, an effort that yielded the conceptual design of the 300-MWth pool-type system ALFRED. LEADER’s eventual goal was a demonstration of an industrial-scale <a href="https://aris.iaea.org/PDF/ELFR.pdf"><span class="s3">630-MWe European LFR (ELFR)</span></a> by 2040,</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s9"> In 2013, after European Union funding for the <a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/249668/reporting"><span class="s3">LEADER program ended</span></a>, Ansaldo brought several European organizations within the </span><span class="s8">FALCON (Fostering ALfred CONstruction) consortium to build a small-scale demonstration reactor. “FALCON already contributed to securing a dedicated loan for the realization of relevant experimental facilities in Romania—in addition to those under construction in the UK at the <a href="https://www.ansaldoenergia.com/companies/ansaldo-nuclear-limited"><span class="s10">Ansaldo Nuclear Ltd</span></a> Wolverhampton site and those historically present in Italy at ENEA Brasimone,” the company said. </span></p>

<p class="p12"><span class="s9">Other notable LFR projects include <a href="https://www.powermag.com/press-releases/rosatom-completes-foundation-concreting-for-the-brest-od-300-reactor/"><span class="s12">Russia’s 300-MWe BREST-300</span></a></span><span class="s12">, which began construction in June 2021. The reactor will run on mixed uranium-plutonium nitride fuel, specially developed for the facility. Private companies like </span><span class="s13">Newcleo (formerly </span><span class="s12">Hydromine) and LeadCold have also developed basic LFR designs.</span></p>
<p class="p12"><span class="s12"> Italian firm Newcleo is developing </span><span class="s13">a liquid lead modular microreactor, the LFR-TL-X, and it intends to finalize its design and realize a non-nuclear industrial prototype within five years. <a href="https://www.newcleo.com/what-we-do/"><span class="s3">It is also </span></a>developing 30-MW and 200-MW LFR concepts. Swedish company LeadCold is separately developing the <a href="https://www.leadcold.com/sealer.html"><span class="s14">SEALER</span></a></span><span class="s8"> (Swedish Advanced Lead Reactor), a 55-MWe reactor, and a smaller microreactor version for Arctic applications. A joint venture between Uniper and LeadCold notably received $10 million in funding from the Swedish Energy Agency in February to support the construction of a demonstration SEALER plant at the OKG’s Oskarshamn plant site. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">While Ansaldo and Westinghouse did not provide details about their planned common LFR design, the companies said the agreement builds upon development activities already underway in the UK, the U.S., Italy, and Romania. “More than 10 state-of-the-art, lead-based test facilities are being installed” in these countries, they said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s7">The companies said the objective of their cooperative agreement to develop an LFR represents a “</span><span class="s3">step change performance improvement relative to traditional nuclear technology, including enhanced economics, market versatility beyond electricity and improved sustainability.”</span></p>

The systems are expected to be fully operational by the end of this year. In addition, Saft Flex’ion batteries will support a microgrid powered by hydroelectric and solar plants, as well as diesel generation, on the island of Ustica. The batteries will be connected to the distribution network and integrated into a smart grid. The installations are the first pieces of the “I-Sole project,” which involves local utilities as well as scientific expertise from the University of Palermo and the Italian National Research Council. The project is supported financially by the European Union and the Region of Sicily, under the technical lead of Layer Electronics, a local power electronics company. The I-Sole project aims to develop innovative technical solutions for monitoring and control of power generation and distribution, with a focus on increasing the use of renewable sources and storage systems on small Sicilian islands while supporting the security of power supply. Flex’ion batteries are assembled in Saft’s Raskovice factory, in the Czech Republic, using lithium-ion cells manufactured in Saft’s Nersac factory in France.</p>
<p><strong>Financing Closed on Polish Solar Plant.</strong> An agreement was reached at the end of August among ib vogt, BayernLB, and Siemens Financial Services for a solar farm already under construction in Poland. The facility is expected to come online early next year. The three groups together are financing the $90 million project, which will have 135 MW of generation capacity. The plant is located near the towns of Zamosc and Szczebrzeszyn in the Lublin voivodeship, or regional area, in the southeast of Poland. Officials said the project is sited in an area with high solar irradiation and low-quality soil, and will feature more than 250,000 solar panels. CMS Poland provided legal advice for construction of the project. Wind Prospect Polska provided technical advice, and Marsh Poland served as insurance adviser. ib vogt, which is headquartered in Berlin, Germany, is the engineering, procurement, and construction lead for the solar farm, and will continue to provide operations and maintenance services after the plant is commissioned. The project has an agreement with Next Kraftwerke to the trading of the project’s electricity on the Polish exchange.</p>
<p><strong>‘Hydrogen-Ready’ Gas Plant Announced for Singapore.</strong> Keppel, an infrastructure conglomerate working in the energy sector, in early September said it has made a final investment decision to build a 600-MW “hydrogen-ready” natural gas-fired facility in Singapore. Keppel officials said the plant would initially be powered by natural gas, but would be designed to eventually run on 100% hydrogen. The Keppel Sakra Cogeneration Plant, scheduled to come online in 2026, would be a combined cycle plant “designed to operate on fuels with 30% hydrogen content and has the capability of shifting to run entirely on hydrogen,” according to officials with the Singapore-based company. Keppel said the plant would utilize Mitsubishi Power JAC-series gas turbines, which at present can only accommodate a fuel mix of up to 30% hydrogen. Keppel officials had not addressed whether the original turbines would be replaced at a future time to burn a higher percentage of hydrogen.</p>
<p><strong>British Group Will Produce Green Hydrogen in Egypt.</strong> Globeleq, a British independent power producer, has received approval from Egyptian officials to produce green hydrogen and derivatives in the Suez Canal Economic Zone. Globeleq said it is looking at a 3.6-GW electrolysis plant. Globeleq signed the agreement with the New and Renewable Energy Authority, the Suez Canal Economic Zone General Authority, the Egyptian Sovereign Wealth Fund for Investment and Development, and the Egyptian Electricity Transmission Co. Globeleq under the terms of the agreement would develop, finance, build, and operate the electrolysis plant, which will produce hydrogen from electricity generated from wind and solar farms. Globeleq said the project will be built in several phases. An initial pilot phase will have an electrolysis capacity of 100 MW. The hydrogen produced will be converted into green ammonia, a needed ingredient for the production of fertilizer. Globeleq also said it plans to produce other hydrogen-derived fuels, including e-methanol, obtained by mixing carbon dioxide and hydrogen.</p>
<p><strong>Rolls-Royce Will Develop SMR Technology in the Netherlands.</strong> The nuclear power group Rolls-Royce SMR in August announced an agreement with ULC-Energy BV, a Dutch nuclear energy development company, to collaborate on the deployment of Rolls-Royce small modular reactor (SMR) power plants in the Netherlands. ULC-Energy is based in Amsterdam. The company is a newcomer to the energy sector—it was established in 2021—and has quickly taken the lead in nuclear power development in the Netherlands. ULC-Energy has said nuclear is important to support decarbonization. It plans to develop projects that would use nuclear power to support industrial and residential energy networks. The Netherlands’ new coalition government late last year said nuclear power would be paramount in its energy policy with regard to combating climate change. Officials outlined a multi-year plan, committing $50 million to the program in 2023, $200 million in 2024, and $250 million in 2025. The government said it expects cumulative financial support for nuclear will hit $5 billion by the end of the decade. Rolls-Royce SMR’s current design is a 470-MWe unit based on pressurized water reactor technology.</p>
<p><strong>Norway-Based Group Obtains Permit for South African Solar Project.</strong> Magnora, a Norwegian energy company, in August said it had received an environmental permit for a solar project the group is developing in South Africa. The 260-MW project is being designed to include a battery energy storage system. Oslo-based Magnora in a statement said, “The environmental clearance means that the project has the majority of the most important permits.” Magnora said the solar farm, whose specific location was not disclosed, is being built “in an area with extremely good solar radiation,” with an expected annual production of more than 600 GWh.</p>

During its 140-year history, the magazine’s pages have reflected the fast-changing evolution of the technologies and markets that characterize the world’s power sector. These are some of the events that have shaped both the history of power and the history of POWER.</strong></em></p>
<p>The history of power generation is long and convoluted, marked by myriad technological milestones, conceptual and technical, from hundreds of contributors. Many accounts begin power’s story at the demonstration of electric conduction by Englishman Stephen Gray, which led to the 1740 invention of glass friction generators in Leyden, Germany. That development is said to have inspired Benjamin Franklin’s famous experiments, as well as the invention of the battery by Italy’s Alessandro Volta in 1800, Humphry Davy’s first effective “arc lamp” in 1808, and in 1820, Hans Christian Oersted’s demonstration of the relationship between electricity and magnetism. In 1820, in arguably the most pivotal contribution to modern power systems, Michael Faraday and Joseph Henry invented a primitive electric motor, and in 1831, documented that an electric current can be produced in a wire moving near a magnet—demonstrating the principle of the generator.</p>
<p>Invention of the first rudimentary dynamo is credited to Frenchman Hippolyte Pixii in 1832. Antonio Pacinotti improved it to provide continuous direct-current (DC) power by 1860. In 1867, Werner von Siemens, Charles Wheatstone, and S.A. Varley nearly simultaneously devised the “self-exciting dynamo-electric generator.” Perhaps the most important improvement then arrived in 1870, when a Belgian inventor, Zenobe Gramme, devised a dynamo that produced a steady DC source well-suited to powering motors—a discovery that generated a burst of enthusiasm about electricity’s potential to light and power the world.</p>
<p>By 1877—as the streets of many cities across the world were being lit up by arc lighting (but not ordinary rooms because arc lights were still blindingly bright)—Ohio-based Charles F. Brush had developed and begun selling the most reliable dynamo design to that point, and a host of forward thinkers were actively exploring the promise of large-scale electricity distribution. Eventually, Thomas Edison invented a less powerful incandescent lamp in 1879, and in September 1882—only a month before the inaugural issue of <i>POWER</i> magazine was published—he established a central generating station at Pearl Street (Figure 1) in lower Manhattan.</p>

<h2>A History Rooted in Coal</h2>
<p>Advances in alternating-current (AC) technology opened up new realms for power generation (see sidebar “Tesla and the War of the Currents”). Hydropower, for example, marked several milestones between 1890 and 1900 in Oregon, Colorado, Croatia (where the first complete multiphase AC system was demonstrated in 1895), at Niagara Falls, and in Japan.</p>

<h2><b>Tesla and the War of the Currents</b></h2>
<p>Today, most people recognize the name Tesla as a company that makes electric vehicles, but the real genius behind the name is not Elon Musk—it’s the Serbian-American engineer and physicist Nikola Tesla. Tesla, for all intents and purposes, was the man who pioneered today’s modern alternating-current (AC) electricity supply system.</p>
<p>Tesla was born in 1856 in Smiljan, Croatia, which was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire at the time. He studied math and physics at the Technical University of Graz in Austria, and also studied philosophy for a time at the University of Prague in what is now the Czech Republic. In 1882, he moved to Paris and got a job repairing direct-current (DC) power plants with the Continental Edison Co. Two years later, he immigrated to the U.S., where he became a naturalized citizen in 1889.</p>
<p>Upon arrival in the U.S., Tesla found a job working for Thomas Edison in New York City, which he did for about a year. Edison was reportedly impressed by Tesla’s skill and work ethic, but the two men were much different in their methods and temperament. Tesla solved many problems through visionary revelations; whereas, Edison relied more on practical experiments and trial-and-error. Furthermore, Tesla believed strongly that AC electrical systems were more practical for large-scale power delivery; whereas, Edison championed DC systems in what has since come to be known as the “War of the Currents.”</p>
<p>Tesla left Edison’s company following a payment dispute over one of Tesla’s dynamo improvements. After his departure, Tesla struggled for a time to find funding to start his own business. When he finally did get his company going, Tesla moved quickly, and over the span of about two years he was granted more than 30 patents for his inventions, which included a whole polyphase system of AC dynamos, transformers, and motors.</p>
<p>Word of Tesla’s innovative ideas spread, leading to an invitation for him to speak before the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. It was here that Tesla caught the eye of George Westinghouse, another AC power pioneer. Soon thereafter, Westinghouse bought the rights to Tesla’s patents and momentum for AC systems picked up.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important battle in the War of the Currents occurred in 1893 during the World’s Columbian Exposition, the official name of the World’s Fair that year, held in Chicago, Illinois. Westinghouse’s company won the bid over Edison’s company to power the fair with electricity, and it did so with Tesla’s polyphase system.</p>
<p>Among the exhibits (Figure 2) displayed at the fair were a switchboard, polyphase generators, step-up transformers, transmission lines, step-down transformers, industrial-sized induction motors and synchronous motors, rotary DC converters, meters, and other auxiliary devices. The demonstration allowed the public to see what an AC power system could look like and what it would be capable of doing. The fact that power could be transmitted over long distances, and utilized even to supply DC systems, opened many peoples’ eyes to the benefits it could provide and spurred movement toward a nationwide AC-powered grid.</p>

<p>In addition to his electrical inventions, Tesla also experimented with X-rays, gave short-range demonstrations of radio communication, and built a radio-controlled boat that he demonstrated for spectators, among other things. Although Tesla was quite famous and respected in his day, he was never able to capture long-term financial success from his inventions. He died in 1943 at the age of 86.</td>

<p>By then, however, coal power generation’s place in power’s history had already been firmly established. The first coal-fired steam generators provided low-pressure saturated or slightly superheated steam for steam engines driving DC dynamos. Sir Charles Parsons, who built the first steam turbine generator (with a thermal efficiency of just 1.6%) in 1884, improved its efficiency two years later by introducing the first condensing turbine, which drove an AC generator.</p>
<p>About a decade later, in 1896, American inventor Charles Curtis offered an invention of a different turbine to the General Electric Co. (GE). By 1901, GE had successfully developed a 500-kW Curtis turbine generator, which employed high-pressure steam to drive rapid rotation of a shaft-mounted disk, and by 1903, it delivered the world’s first 5-MW steam turbine to the Commonwealth Edison Co. of Chicago. Subsequent models, which received improvement boosts suggested by GE’s Dr. Sanford Moss, were used mostly as mechanical drives or as peaking units.</p>
<p>By the early 1900s, coal-fired power units featured outputs in the 1 MW to 10 MW range, outfitted with a steam generator, an economizer, evaporator, and a superheater section. By the 1910s, the coal-fired power plant cycle was improved even more by the introduction of turbines with steam extractions for feedwater heating and steam generators equipped with air preheaters—all which boosted net efficiency to about 15%.</p>
<p>The demonstration of pulverized coal steam generators at the Oneida Street Station in Wisconsin in 1919 vastly improved coal combustion, allowing for bigger boilers (Figure 3). In the 1920s, another technological boost came with the advent of once-through boiler applications and reheat steam power plants, along with the Benson steam generator, which was built in 1927. Reheat steam turbines became the norm in the 1930s, when unit ratings soared to a 300-MW output level. Main steam temperatures consistently increased through the 1940s, and the decade also ushered in the first attempts to clean flue gas with dust removal. The 1950s and 1960s were characterized by more technical achievements to improve efficiency—including construction of the first once-through steam generator with a supercritical main steam pressure.</p>

<p>Unit ratings of 1,300 MW were reached by the 1970s. In 1972, the world’s first integrated coal gasification combined cycle power plant—a 183-MW power plant for the German generator STEAG—began operations. Mounting environmental concerns and the subsequent passage of the Clean Air Act by the Nixon administration in the 1970s, however, also spurred technical solutions such as scrubbers to mitigate sulfur dioxide emissions. The decade ended with completion of a pioneering commercial fluidized bed combustion plant built on the Georgetown University campus in Washington, D.C., in 1979.</p>
<p>The early 1980s, meanwhile, were marked by the further development of emissions control technologies, including the introduction of selective catalytic reduction systems as a secondary measure to mitigate nitrogen oxide emissions. Component performance also saw vast improvements during that period to the 21st century. Among the most recent major milestones in coal power’s history is completion of the first large-scale coal-fired power unit outfitted with carbon capture and storage technology in 2014 at Boundary Dam in Saskatchewan, Canada (see sidebar “The 2010s Marked Extraordinary Change for Power”).</p>

<h2><b>The 2010s Marked Extraordinary Change for Power</b></h2>
<p>Every one of the 13 decades that <em>POWER</em> magazine has been in print has been definitive for electric generation technology, policy, and business in some significant way, but few have been as transformative as the 2010s. The decade opened just as the global economy began to crawl toward recovery from a historically unprecedented downturn that had bludgeoned industrial production and sent global financial markets into chaos.</p>
<p>The ensuing social consciousness fueled an environmental movement, which policymakers championed. Heightened concerns about climate change—driven by a globally embraced urgency to act—propelled energy transformations across the world, resulting in a clear shift in power portfolios away from coal and toward low- or zero-carbon resources. That shift has come with concerted emphasis on flexibility. Effecting a notable cultural change, the decarbonization movement has been championed by power company shareholders and customers, and some of the biggest coal generators in the world have announced ambitions to go net-zero by mid-century.</p>
<p>However, the shift has also benefited from a hard economic edge. Transformations, for example, have been enabled by technology innovations that cracked open a vast new realm of natural gas supply, sent the prices of solar panels and batteries plummeting, and made small-scale decentralized generation possible, while the uptake of digitalization has soared, mainly to prioritize efficiency gains.</p>
<p>Disruption continues to define the power industry today. The chaotic global pandemic that jolted the world in 2020 unfolded into a precarious set of energy crises in 2021. After a cold snap prompted mass generation outages across a swath of the central U.S., most prominently in Texas, volatile energy markets and power supply vulnerabilities jacked-up turmoil in California, China, India, and across Europe and Latin America. In 2022, Russia’s occupation of Ukraine and its economic war with the West prompted a new set of energy security concerns that have remained pitted against power affordability and sustainability interests.</td>

<h2>Gas Power Takes Off</h2>
<p class="04Body1stPara">Coal power technology’s evolution was swift owing to soaring power demand and a burgeoning mining sector. The natural gas power sector, which today takes the lion’s share of both U.S. installed capacity and generation, was slower to take off. Although the essential elements of a gas turbine engine were first patented by English inventor John Barber in 1791, it took more than a century before the concepts were really put to practical use.</p>
<p class="04Body">In 1903, Jens William Aegidius Elling, a Norwegian engineer, researcher, and inventor, built the first gas turbine to produce more power than was needed to run its own components. Elling’s first design used both rotary compressors and turbines to produce about 8 kW. He further refined the machine in subsequent years, and by 1912, he had developed a gas turbine system with separate turbine unit and compressor in series, a combination that is still common today.</p>
<p class="04Body">Gas turbine technology continued to be enhanced by a number of innovative pioneers from various countries. In 1930, Britain’s Sir Frank Whittle patented a design for a jet engine. Gyorgy Jendrassik demonstrated Whittle’s design in Budapest, Hungary, in 1937. In 1939, a German Heinkel HE 178 aircraft flew successfully with an engine designed by Hans von Ohain that used the exhaust from a gas turbine for propulsion. The same year, Brown Boveri Co. installed the first gas turbine used for electric power generation in Neuchatel, Switzerland. Both Whittle’s and von Ohain’s first jet engines were based on centrifugal compressors.</p>
<p>Innovations in aircraft technology, and engineering and manufacturing advancements during both World Wars propelled gas power technology to new heights, however. At GE, for example, engineers who participated in development of jet engines put their know-how into designing a gas turbine for industrial and utility service. Following development of a gas turbine-electric locomotive in 1948, GE installed its first commercial gas turbine for power generation—a 3.5-MW heavy-duty unit—at the Belle Isle Station owned by Oklahoma Gas &amp; Electric in July 1949 (Figure 4). Some experts point out that because that unit used exhaust heat for feedwater heating of a steam turbine unit, it was essentially also the world’s first combined cycle power plant. That same year, Westinghouse put online a 1.3-MW unit at the River Fuel Corp. in Mississippi.</p>

<p class="04Body">Large heavy-duty gas turbine technology rapidly improved thereafter. In the early 1950s, firing temperatures were 1,300F (705C), by the late 1950s, they had soared to 1,500F, and eventually reached 2,000F in 1975. By 1957, a general surge in gas turbine unit sizes led to the installment of the first heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) for a gas turbine. By 1965, the first fully fired boiler combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power plant came online, and by 1968, the first CCGT was outfitted with a HRSG. The late 1960s, meanwhile, was characterized by gas turbine suppliers starting to develop pre-designed or standard CCGT plants. GE developed the STAG (steam and gas) system, for example, Westinghouse, the PACE (Power at combined efficiency) system, and Siemens, the GUD (gas and steam) system.</p>
<p class="04Body">The past few decades, meanwhile, have been characterized by a proliferation of large heavy-duty gas turbines that are highly flexible and efficient, and can combust multiple fuels, including high volumes of hydrogen. That development is rooted in a combustion breakthrough in the 1990s that enabled a “lean premixed combustion process.” Compared to the early days of “dry-low NO<sub><span class="04Bodysubscript">x</span></sub>” (DLN) technology, when turbine inlet temperatures (TIT) of 1,350C–1,400C (for the vintage F class) were common, the past two decades have ushered in “advanced class” gas turbines with TIT pushing the 1,700C mark.</p>
<p class="04Body">Advanced gas turbine technology has also led to new world records in CCGT efficiency and gas turbine power output. Specifically, GE Power announced in March 2018 that the Chubu Electric Nishi-Nagoya power plant Block-1, powered by a GE 7HA gas turbine and Toshiba Energy Systems &amp; Solutions Corp.’s steam turbine and generator technology, had been recognized by Guinness World Records as the world’s “most efficient combined-cycle power plant,” based on achieving 63.08% gross efficiency. In August 2022, Duke Energy’s Lincoln Combustion Turbine Station, powered by a Siemens Energy SGT6-9000HL gas turbine, was certified with the official Guinness World Records title for the “most powerful simple-cycle gas power plant” with an output of 410.9 MW.</p>
<h2>Atomic Discoveries</h2>
<p>Although the concept of the atom was fairly well developed, scientists had not yet figured out how to harness the energy contained in atoms when the first issue of <i>POWER</i> magazine was published. But 13 years later, in 1895, the accidental discovery of X-rays by Wilhelm Röntgen started a wave of experimentation in the atomic field.</p>
<p>In the years that followed, radiation was discovered by Antoine Henri Becquerel, a French physicist; the Curies—Marie and Pierre—conducted additional radiation research and coined the term “radioactivity”; and Ernest Rutherford, a New Zealand-born British physicist, who many people consider the father of nuclear science, postulated the structure of the atom, proposed the laws of radioactive decay, and conducted groundbreaking research into the transmutation of elements.</p>
<p>Many other scientists were helping advance the world’s understanding of atomic principles. Albert Einstein developed his theory of special relativity, E = mc<sup>2</sup>, where E is energy, m is mass, and c is the speed of light, in 1905. Niels Bohr published his model of the atom in 1913, which was later perfected by James Chadwick when he discovered the neutron.</p>
<p>Enrico Fermi, an Italian physicist, in 1934 showed that neutrons could split atoms. Two German scientists—Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassman—expanded on that knowledge in 1938 when they discovered fission, and using Einstein’s theory, the team showed that the lost mass turned to energy.</p>
<h2>Early Nuclear Reactors</h2>
<p>Scientists then turned their attention to developing a self-sustaining chain reaction. To do so, a “critical mass” of uranium needed to be placed under the right conditions. Fermi, who emigrated to the U.S. in 1938 to escape fascist Italy’s racial laws, led a group of scientists at the University of Chicago in constructing the world’s first nuclear reactor.</p>
<p>The team’s design consisted of uranium placed in a stack of graphite to make a cube-like frame of fissionable material. The pile, known as Chicago Pile-1, was erected on the floor of a squash court beneath the University of Chicago’s athletic stadium (Figure 5). On December 2, 1942, the first self-sustaining nuclear reaction was demonstrated in Chicago Pile-1.</p>

<p>But the U.S. was a year into World War II at the time, and most of the atomic research being done then was focused on developing weapons technology. It was not until after the war that the U.S. government began encouraging the development of nuclear energy for peaceful civilian purposes. The first reactor to produce electricity from nuclear energy was Experimental Breeder Reactor I, on December 20, 1951, in Idaho.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union had a burgeoning nuclear power program at the time too. Its scientists modified an existing graphite-moderated channel-type plutonium production reactor for heat and electricity generation. In June 1954, that unit, located in Obninsk, began generating electricity. A few years later, on December 18, 1957, the first commercial U.S. nuclear power plant—Shippingport Atomic Power Station, a light-water reactor with a 60-MW capacity—was synchronized to the power grid in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The U.S. and Soviet Union weren’t the only countries building nuclear plants, however. The UK, Germany, Japan, France, and several others were jumping on the bandwagon too. The industry grew rapidly during the 1960s and 1970s. Nuclear construction projects were on drawing boards across the U.S., with 41 new units ordered in 1973 alone. But slower electricity demand growth, construction delays, cost overruns, and complicated regulatory requirements, put an end to the heyday in the mid-1970s. Nearly half of all planned U.S. projects ended up being canceled. Nonetheless, by 1991 the U.S. had twice as many operating commercial reactors—112 units—as any other country in the world.</p>
<p>Nuclear power’s history is tainted by three major accidents. The first was the partial meltdown of Three Mile Island Unit 2 on March 28, 1979. A combination of equipment malfunctions, design-related problems, and worker errors led to the meltdown. The second major accident occurred on April 26, 1986. That event was triggered by a sudden surge of power during a reactor systems test on Unit 4 at the Chernobyl nuclear power station in Ukraine, in the former Soviet Union. The accident and a subsequent fire released massive amounts of radioactive material into the environment.</p>
<p>The most-recent major accident occurred following a 9.0-magnitude earthquake off the coast of Japan on March 11, 2011. The quake caused the Fukushima Daiichi station to lose all off-site power. Backup systems worked, but 40 minutes after the quake, a 14-meter-high tsunami struck the area, knocking some of them out. Three reactors eventually overheated—melting their cores to some degree—then hydrogen explosions spread radioactive contamination throughout the area.</p>
<p class="04Body">The consequences of accidents have played a role in decisions to phase out or cut back reliance on nuclear power in some countries including Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, and Spain. Nonetheless, China, Russia, India, the United Arab Emirates, the U.S., and others continue to build new units, incorporating a lot of modern power plant technology (see sidebar “The Rise of IIoT”).</p>

<h2><b>The Rise of IIoT</b></h2>
<p>Power plant automation was already well-advanced by 2009, when more facilities shed boiler-turbine generator boards and vertical panels populated with indicators and strip chart recorders, and adopted open systems using industry-standard hardware and software. By then, companies were already beginning to grasp the value of digital modeling and virtual simulation, as well as sensors and wireless technologies.</p>
<p>The definitive shift arrived around 2012 with the introduction of the concept of the “industrial internet of things” (IIoT)—a term GE claims it coined—which described the connection between machines, advanced analytics, and the people who use them. According to GE, IIoT is “the network of a multitude of industrial devices connected by communications technologies that results in systems that can monitor, collect, exchange, analyze, and deliver valuable new insights like never before. These insights can then help drive smarter, faster business decisions for industrial companies.”</p>
<p>In the power sector, IIoT morphed into a multi-billion-dollar industry, and it has since enabled predictive analytics to forecast and detect component issues; it provides real-time production data (Big Data), which has opened up a realm of possibilities; and enabled software solutions—all of which have boosted efficiency, productivity, and performance. Over the last decade, several companies have rolled out comprehensive power plant–oriented IIoT platforms, such as GE’s Predix and Siemens’ MindSphere, and driven the rapid development of technologies that benefit from them, such as fourth-generation sensors, Big Data, edge intelligence, as well as augmented and virtual reality, and artificial intelligence and machine learning.</p>
<p>Separately, these and other digital possibilities have opened up a vast intelligence realm for other aspects of the power sector, including for grid—such as for forecasting, grid stability, outage response, distributed energy resource orchestration, communications, and mobility. Components manufacturing, too, is digitally evolving, with advancements in 3D printing, development of new materials, and process intensification.</td>

<h2>Renewables: The World’s Oldest and Newest Energy Sources</h2>
<p>While humans have been harnessing energy from the sun, wind, and water for thousands of years, technology has changed significantly over the course of history, and these ancient energy types have developed into state-of-the-art innovative power generation sources.</p>
<p><b>Chasing Water.</b> What became modern renewable energy generation got its start in the late 1800s, around the time that <i>POWER </i>launched. Hydropower was first to transition to a commercial electricity generation source, and it advanced very quickly. In 1880, Michigan’s Grand Rapids Electric Light and Power Co. generated DC electricity using hydropower at the Wolverine Chair Co. A belt-driven dynamo powered by a water turbine at the factory lit 16 arc street lamps.</p>
<p>Just two years later, the world’s first central DC hydroelectric station powered a paper mill in Appleton, Wisconsin. By 1886, there were 40 to 50 hydroelectric plants operating in the U.S. and Canada alone, and by 1888, roughly 200 electric companies relied on hydropower for at least some of their electricity generation (see sidebar “The Evolution of Power Business Models”). In 1889, the nation’s first AC hydroelectric plant came online, the Willamette Falls Station in Oregon City, Oregon.</p>

<td class="photocaption">
<h2><b>The Evolution of Power Business Models</b></h2>
<p>The birth of the modern electric utility began when Thomas Edison invented the practical lightbulb in 1878, and, to spur demand for the novel invention, developed an entire power system that generated and distributed electricity. While the concept caught on in several cities in the early years, owing to exorbitant costs, power companies rarely owned several power plants.</p>
<p>Samuel Insull, who began his role as president at Chicago Edison in 1892, is credited with first exploiting load factor, not only finding power customers for off-peak times, but leveraging technology including larger generation systems and alternating current to produce and transmit power more cheaply. Crucially, he is also said to have pioneered consolidation; he acquired 20 small utilities by 1907 to give birth to a natural monopoly—Commonwealth Edison.</p>
<p>The model was widely emulated, and for decades, scale economies associated with large centralized generation technologies encouraged vertical integration to drive down power costs, encourage universal access, and provide reliability. To enforce the responsibilities and rights of these investor-owned utilities (IOUs) and their customers, however, this approach also spurred more government oversight and regulation. It also gave rise to both municipal ownership, and later, as a New Deal measure, public power to enable rural electrification.</p>
<p>Business models began to shift more distinctively starting in the late 1970s, as environmental policy, the oil shocks, and initiatives to open the airline and trucking industries to competition disrupted the status quo. The evolution that happened in the last 40 years, which has left an enduring legacy, is often categorized into two big buckets: the introduction of competition, and reforming the way monopoly utilities operate. A key step to initiating reforms in the U.S. stemmed from passage of the Public Utilities Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) of 1978, which essentially created opportunities for smaller generators to get into the game.</p>
<p>The final, but just as significant, historical upheaval was energy deregulation. In the 1990s, holding competition as the most effective driver of low power costs, several states also moved to end monopoly protections for retail sales—though after California’s high-profile energy crisis in 2000 and 2001, many scaled back their plans and even re-regulated their retail sectors. Deregulation had the important role of giving rise to new retail companies, whose business models were exclusively focused on delivery of power to the customer.</p>
<p>If and how these models thrive, however, is questionable. Decarbonization, decentralization, and digitalization—as well as the recent impact from the COVID-19 pandemic—have slackened or prompted a decline in power demand. At the same time, traditional regulatory approaches, which have been predicated on growth, must grapple with an increasingly complex industry landscape. The past decades have ushered in two-way flows of electricity, more stringent environmental policies, and state goals. Regulators are challenged with ensuring power systems are operating efficiently, complying with environmental goals, remain reliable, and address equity issues for low-income customers.</td>

<p>Internationally, Switzerland was at the forefront of pumped storage, opening the world’s first such plant in 1909. Pumped storage wasn’t integrated into the U.S. energy mix until 1930 when Connecticut Electric Light and Power Co. erected a pumped storage plant in New Milford, Connecticut.</p>
<p><b>Blowing in the Wind.</b> At about the same time that hydropower was gaining popularity, inventors were also figuring out how to use the windmills of the past to generate electricity for the future. In 1888, Charles Brush, an inventor in Ohio, constructed a 60-foot wind turbine in his backyard (Figure 6). The windmill’s wheel was 56 feet in diameter and had 144 blades. A shaft inside the tower turned pulleys and belts, which spun a 12-kW dynamo that was connected to batteries in Brush’s basement.</p>

<p>Wind-powered turbines slowly and with little fanfare spread throughout the world. The American Midwest, where the turbines were used to power irrigation pumps, saw numerous installations. In 1941, the world saw the first 1.25-MW turbine connected to the grid on a hill in Castleton, Vermont, called Grandpa’s Knob.</p>
<p>Interest in wind power was renewed by the oil crisis of the 1970s, which spurred research and development. Wind power in the U.S. got a policy boost when President Jimmy Carter signed the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, which required companies to buy a certain amount of electricity from renewable energy sources, including wind.</p>
<p class="04Body">By the 1980s, the first utility-scale wind farms began popping up in California. Europe has been the leader in offshore wind, with the first offshore wind farm installed in 1991 in Denmark. According to Wind Europe, Europe had 236 GW of installed wind capacity at the end of 2021, a significant increase from the 12.6 GW of capacity that was grid-connected five years earlier.</p>
<p class="04Body">In late 2016, the first offshore wind farm in the U.S., a five-turbine, 30-MW project, began operation in the waters off of Block Island, Rhode Island. Yet, by 2022, only one additional offshore wind project had been added to the U.S. grid—the two-turbine Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind pilot project with a generating capacity of 12 MW. However, onshore wind installations have fared much better. By mid-2022, more than 139 GW of onshore wind capacity was grid-connected in the U.S., according to American Clean Power, a renewable energy advocacy group.</p>
<p><b>Let the Sunshine In.</b> Compared to other commercially available renewable energy sources, solar power is in its infancy, though the path that led to its commercial use began almost 200 years ago. In 1839, French scientist Edmond Becquerel discovered the photovoltaic (PV) effect by experimenting with an electrolytic cell made of two metal electrodes in a conducting solution. Becquerel found that electricity generation increased when it was exposed to light.</p>
<p>More than three decades later, an English electrical engineer named Willoughby Smith discovered the photoconductivity of selenium. By 1882 the first solar cell was created by New York inventor Charles Fritts, who coated selenium with a layer of gold to develop a cell with an energy conversion rate of just 1–2%.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until the 1950s, however, that silicon solar cells were produced commercially. Physicists at Bell Laboratories determined silicon to be more efficient than selenium. The cell created by Bell Labs was “the first solar cell capable of converting enough of the sun’s energy into power to run everyday electrical equipment,” according to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).</p>
<p>By the 1970s, the efficiency of solar cells had increased, and they began to be used to power navigation warning lights and horns on many offshore gas and oil rigs, lighthouses, and railroad crossing signals. Domestic solar applications began to be viewed as sensible alternatives in remote locations where grid-connected options were not affordable.</p>
<p>The 1980s saw significant progress in the development of more-efficient, more-powerful solar projects. In 1982, the first PV megawatt-scale power station, developed by ARCO Solar, came online in Hesperia, California. Also in 1982, the DOE began operating Solar One, a 10-MW central-receiver demonstration project, the first project to prove the feasibility of power tower technology. Then, in 1992, researchers at the University of South Florida developed a 15.9%-efficient thin-film PV cell, the first to break the 15% efficiency barrier. By the mid-2000s, residential solar power systems were available for sale in home improvement stores.</p>
<p>In 2016, solar power from utility-scale facilities accounted for less than 0.9% of U.S. electricity generation. However, the solar industry has gained significant momentum since then. According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, there was more than 126 GW of solar power capacity installed in the U.S. at the end of March 2022, and the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that almost 4% of U.S. electricity came from solar energy in 2021.
