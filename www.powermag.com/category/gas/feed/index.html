<p class="p5"><span class="s3">The companies, in a joint statement <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221019005429/en">on Oct. 19</a>, said they intend to collaborate on a joint study to evaluate and potentially advance the potential project. The project could entail “the end-to-end energy value chain, utilizing each participant’s technical expertise in production, operational experience, storage, distribution, and export logistics,” the companies said. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">While the companies did not specify a size for the project, each of the consortium’s partners has been separately developing capabilities and expertise in air separation technology, hydrogen technologies, lower carbon intensity and renewable natural gas, carbon capture and storage (CCS), electrolysis-based technologies, and petrochemicals.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">The companies said that the project could “leverage existing advantages along the Gulf Coast, including pipeline infrastructure, to supply lower carbon and renewable hydrogen to local industrial clusters.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Likewise, “ammonia infrastructure could support exports to both Europe and the Asia Pacific region,” they said.</span></p>
<h2>A Skilled Consortium</h2>
<p class="p6"><span class="s4">Air Liquide, a world leader in industrial gas supply, including oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen, in January 2021, inaugurated one of the world’s largest proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers in </span><span class="s5">Bécancour, Québec. The 20-MW PEM electrolyzer, equipped with Cummins technology, sources wind and hydropower from </span><span class="s6">Hydro-Québec for the hydrogen market in the northeast. The PEM project supplied a </span><span class="s3">recently completed <a href="https://www.powermag.com/nypa-ge-successfully-pilot-hydrogen-retrofit-at-aeroderivative-gas-turbine/"><span class="s7">GE aeroderivative gas turbine </span></a>project to demonstrate hydrogen combustion as part of a retrofit at an existing U.S. natural gas power plant, which successfully utilized blends of 5% to 44% hydrogen with natural gas</span><span class="s6">. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s8">“</span><span class="s3">The Gulf Coast is the ideal location to model hydrogen and carbon capture technologies as immediate pathways to decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors. This project exemplifies Air Liquide’s commitment to decarbonizing industrial basins around the world,” said Adam Peters, CEO of Air Liquide North America. “Prioritizing sustainable technologies, like hydrogen and carbon capture, means we can provide energy transition careers for many thousands of American workers while building a more sustainable energy future for all.” </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s3">Uniper, Germany’s giant utility that holds a 33 GW generation fleet, is working to decarbonize its business in Europe by 2035, including its 2,200 TWh natural gas procurement portfolio. While the German government recently took over the company, the company has been working on several hydrogen initiatives, including <a href="https://www.powermag.com/windgas-falkenhagen-pioneering-green-gas-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">power-to-gas</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s3">“Uniper is very excited to collaborate with this unique group of companies to explore a truly transformative U.S. Gulf Coast hydrogen infrastructure project,” Marc Merrill, President and CEO of Uniper in North America, said in a statement. “We look forward to bringing the best of our U.S. business and global technical and commercial platforms to support this effort. Uniper is committed to the green expansion of our Wilhelmshaven [liquefied natural gas] receiving terminal in Germany and expects to receive and store roughly 1 [million tonnes per annum (Mpta)] of clean ammonia at the port by the end of the decade. U.S. Gulf Coast supply from this initiative can be critical to meeting that goal.”</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">Chevron, an integrated energy company that produces crude oil and natural gas; manufactures transportation fuels, lubricants, petrochemicals, and additives, is actively investing in scalable low-carbon solutions under its <a href="https://www.chevron.com/operations/new-energies">Chevron New Energies</a> business segment. The company already produces </span><span class="s9">about 1 million tonnes per year of hydrogen through its traditional business and has experience in retail hydrogen going back to 2005. The company is also actively deploying CCS, including at  <a href="https://www.chevron.com/projects/gorgon"><span class="s10">Gorgon</span></a>, Australia, one of the world’s largest integrated CCS projects. “</span><span class="s3">Across the value chain, collaborations are critical to developing a hydrogen ecosystem, and this is an example of bringing together leaders in the space to explore lower carbon hydrogen opportunities and to contribute complementary expertise,” said Austin Knight, vice president of Hydrogen at Chevron New Energies. </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s3">LyondellBasell has also recently stepped up its circularity and climate ambitions and actions to address the global challenges of plastic waste and decarbonization. “While our products play an important role in helping to enable greenhouse gas emissions reductions through their use in renewable energy technologies, such as wind turbines, solar panels and electric batteries, we are also taking concrete steps to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from our operations,” said Aaron Ledet, senior vice president of Olefins and Polyolefins Americas at LyondellBasell.</span></p>
<h2>Major Projects Developing on the Gulf Coast</h2>
<p class="p12"><span class="s2">The consortium’s announced plans follow several significant announcements in recent months by major energy and chemical companies for the Gulf Coast. In September, OCI N.V., an Amsterdam, Netherlands–headquartered producer and distributor of hydrogen-based products that provides low-carbon fertilizers, fuels, and feedstock to agricultural, transportation, and industrial customers, said it would leverage the </span><span class="s11">Inflation Reduction Act (IRA’s) 45Q measures to kick off construction of a 1.1 Mtpa blue ammonia facility that will feature infrastructure to enable potentially doubling its capacity to 2.2 Mtpa.</span></p>
<p class="p14"><span class="s3">“Blue ammonia is produced from hydrogen derived from natural gas where the CO</span><sub><span class="s12">2</span></sub><span class="s3"> by-product is captured and sequestered. Green ammonia is produced from hydrogen based on renewable sources such as wind and solar rather than fossil fuels,” the company explained. OCI noted that its two core products, ammonia and methanol, “are the most promising hydrogen carriers to drive the hydrogen economy and enable the energy transition.” </span></p>
<p class="p14"><span class="s3">OCI’s project has been designed to transition from blue to green ammonia production in the future as green hydrogen becomes available at larger scale,” the company said.” OCI has reported the project is well underway. Detailed engineering and procurement work started earlier this year, and production is targeted for Q1 2025, the <a href="https://www.oci.nl/news/2022-oci-to-start-construction-of-new-world-scale-hydrogen-based-blue-ammonia-facility-in-texas-with-production-expected-in-q1-2025/"><span class="s13">company said</span></a>. The “optimal location” in Beaumont, Texas, near Houston, has “easy access to both the US and export markets including Europe and Asia to serve significant expected demand for clean hydrogen,” it said. </span></p>
<p class="p15"><span class="s4">In another notable project announced in September, Uniper and Japanese power giant JERA said they will collaborate with<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></span><span class="s14">ConocoPhillips to pursue fuel supply projects for clean ammonia and LNG to meet </span><span class="s15">domestic demand and JERA’s and Uniper’s European fuel supply needs across the short-, medium- and long-term. The companies are developing green and blue ammonia export projects. One project envisions initial production of 2 Mtpa with expansion potential from the Gulf Coast, including both green and blue clean ammonia production when CCS facilities are available.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s3">A project engineering study is slated to be completed by year-end to develop the first phase of the project, which will assess green and blue hydrogen opportunities. JERA and Uniper expect the project will reach commercial operation in the late 2020s, including a complete certified CCS program.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="s3">“Both companies are working jointly to optimize their LNG portfolio. As a result, Uniper will be able to supply additional LNG to Germany and JERA to Japan and beyond,” the <a href="https://www.uniper.energy/news/jera-and-uniper-announce-collaboration-on-clean-ammonia-and-lng-from-the-united-states"><span class="s16">companies said</span></a>. </span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="s3">“The combination of a skilled workforce, plentiful natural gas, abundant renewable resources, deep-water ports, and ideal CCS geology make the U.S. Gulf Coast uniquely advantaged to produce the low carbon fuel to enable the Atlantic and Pacific energy markets transition,” noted Steven Winn, CEO of JERA Americas, which is based in Houston. “JERA and ConocoPhillips will be a low-cost ammonia supplier to domestic and international markets. We believe this project offers a unique opportunity to support Germany’s decarbonization efforts while advancing ammonia technology development for hydrogen distribution and industrial decarbonization.”</span></p>

Global companies have been transitioning from traditional fossil fuels to specialty fossil fuels, such as industrial heating oil (IHO) and CO<sub>2</sub>-as-Energy. In addition to cost savings (25% to 30%), they offer relatively high heat output. Due to this, companies across industries, especially in Europe, actively seek specialty fossil fuel alternatives. Therefore, to build resiliency, it is imperative for procurement heads to leverage the supply market featuring more than 700 companies by tapping different categories of suppliers.</em></strong></p>
<p>Amid the rising supply chain issues (Europe’s ban on Russian gas), energy crisis, and expanding costs, companies are increasingly moving away from traditional fossil fuels to actively scout for alternates. They are on the lookout for best-suited alternatives from the perspectives of application use case, supply economics, and pricing fit. In lieu of this, it is imperative to understand the current market situation for natural gas and its impact on price as the rationale for the transition to alternate fuels.</p>
<h2>Ongoing Gas Crisis</h2>
<p>The ongoing global energy crisis is one of the worst circular energy shortages experienced over the last five decades. The crisis has emerged across the oil, gas, and electricity markets, particularly impacting Europe and China, among others.</p>
<p>The Russia-Ukraine war has been fueling the gas crisis, with the European sanctions against Russia leading to a crucial supply deficit in the market. The struggle to secure global supplies is becoming more intense, as countries compete to secure scarce cargo of liquefied natural gas (LNG) ahead of winter in the Northern Hemisphere. In Europe, gas prices surged more than sevenfold since 2021, crossing $50/MMBtu in July 2022. With no relief in prices expected in the middle term, companies have been evaluating alternative fuels in the market.</p>
<h2>Alternative Fossil Fuels to the Rescue</h2>
<p>In the short-to-middle term, companies seek ways to de-risk their procurement process and enhance their dependency on specialty fossil fuels for production. Industrial heating oil (IHO) is one such key alternative.</p>
<p>IHO is another energy source that companies are interested in using in their boilers and other heating machinery. IHO is cost-effective over its counterparts of fossil fuels, considering the current prices for IHO are 25% to 30% lower than those for natural gas. Moreover, IHO provides higher heat output (138,690 Btus per gallon) compared with natural gas (1,030 Btus per cubic foot; 135 cubic feet equals heat content of 1 gallon of oil) at a lesser cost and can be stored and used for years.</p>
<p>From the sourcing standpoint, it is imperative to leverage the multiple sources/categories of suppliers, especially in European markets, such as the refineries wherein crude oil distillate and feedstock are refined and oil products are traded. Furthermore, the industries can also tap wholesalers/distributors (greater than 400 in Europe) and tank storage facility/terminal providers (100 to 150 in Europe).</p>
<h2>Undoubted CO<sub>2</sub> Potential</h2>
<p>While carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is more famous for its adverse environmental impact, it is a valuable commodity that can be put to good industrial usage to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and work toward sustainability/climate control while resolving issues faced by industries in terms of energy requirements. According to a report by the International Energy Agency (IEA), globally, about 230 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub> are used every year by industries, with fertilizer makers being the frontrunners, followed by oil and gas companies. Considering the growing potential of CO<sub>2</sub>, it is imperative to tap multiple sources/categories of suppliers, especially in Europe and Latin America, such as bio LNG plants, carbon capture and utilization (CCU), industrial CO<sub>2</sub> bulk cylinder suppliers, industrial CO<sub>2</sub> manufacturers, fertilizer manufacturers, as well as the distributors/importers of CO<sub>2</sub>. These existing suppliers can be leveraged for various needs such as CO<sub>2</sub>, liquid CO<sub>2</sub>, and bio/green CO<sub>2</sub>, while the dedicated carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects/programs can be considered for securing CO<sub>2</sub> supplies from a mid- to long-term perspective.</p>
<h2>Biofuels—The Long-Term Target</h2>
<p>Although CO<sub>2</sub> and IHO are increasingly considered alternatives by companies to reduce the impact of supply chain disruptions, trade tension, and environmental concerns on functioning, the sustainable solution to these concerns, and a robust and healthy tomorrow, lies in biofuels.</p>
<p>Currently, companies are sourcing biofuels such as bioethanol and biodiesel as clean/sustainable alternatives to traditional fossil fuels such as natural gas, diesel, and kerosene. The use of these biofuels not only leads to reduced maintenance of boilers/other heating equipment due to their clean nature but also exhibits effective long-term solutions characterizing sustainability/decarbonization advantage. The next-generation biofuels such as advanced bioethanol, biomethanol, green diesel, and hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) biodiesel are imminent to gain traction in days to come. We will soon see bioenergy stocks trading higher than fossil fuels on the bourses, and the economic well-being of a country being defined based on its bioenergy capacities over petrochemicals.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>It is imperative for global procurement leads/category managers to assess supply chain jeopardies, track volatility, and gauge price risks associated with the sourcing of traditional fossil fuels. It is highly critical to actively watch out for supply options available across specialty fossil fuels such as IHO and CO<sub>2</sub> to build a resilient supply chain. Therefore, the takeaways are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leverage the European IHO supply market characterizing the presence of greater than 500 companies by tapping various supplier categories such as refinery companies, wholesalers/distributors, and specialty tank storage facility providers.</li>
<li>Tap the CO<sub>2</sub> energy market across Europe and Latin America by exploring the supplier landscape of more than 200 companies and prioritizing different categories such as bio LNG plants, CCUs, bulk cylinder suppliers, industrial manufacturers, fertilizer manufacturers, and CO<sub>2</sub></li>
</ul>

Countries have issued targets to reduce or even eliminate the use of traditional fossil fuels in order to reduce emission of greenhouse gases such as CO<sub>2</sub>. Gas turbine original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are responding by investing in hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) combustion. They are spending heavily on the development of combustors and other components that will enable gas turbines to operate with hydrogen blends. Some have issued roadmaps on how they will eventually operate their entire fleets with H<sub>2</sub>. This is seen as a key aspect of ongoing decarbonization efforts (Figure 1).</p>

As more plants blend hydrogen with natural gas, HRSGs will have to be upgraded to cope. Source: Archie Robb</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>“Natural gas generation with 30% hydrogen by volume delivers an 11% reduction in CO<sub>2</sub>,” said Richard Saab, a sales manager at Siemens Energy.</p>
<p>While hydrogen-fired gas turbines are big news, a lot less attention is being paid to the impact of hydrogen on other areas of the gas-powered generation supply chain such as heat recovery steam generators (HRSGs). Yet, a great deal of the global gas turbine fleet operates in combined cycle mode with the turbines connected to HRSGs. Those HRSGs will have to deal with factors such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hydrogen has a higher flame temperature than natural gas.</li>
<li>The water dewpoint of the flue gas increases when firing hydrogen.</li>
<li>Colder parts of the HRSG in contact with flue gas will suffer from high levels of condensation.</li>
<li>H<sub>2</sub> combustion requires a higher volume of exhaust gas flow than natural gas.</li>
<li>Hydrogen introduces additional safety concerns that must be dealt with.</li>
</ul>
<p>“Boiler makers have decades of experience in dealing with hydrogen,” said Kevin Slepicka, vice president of HRSGs at HRSG manufacturer Rentech Boiler Systems. “HRSGs present some additional challenges, but these are well within the capabilities of the vendor community.”</p>
<h2>HRSG Basics</h2>
<p>HRSGs are high-efficiency heat exchangers that are used to extract heat from an exhaust gas stream to convert water into steam for use in combined cycle generation, or to produce steam for use in industrial processes. They consist of a complex arrangement of pipes with water flowing through them. When water exchanges heat with the hot gas, it is converted into steam. The primary components within the HRSG are the superheater, the evaporator, and the economizer (Figure 2). Duct burners are usually installed before the superheaters, while selective catalytic reduction (SCR) units are often deployed to reduce NO<sub>x</sub> levels.</p>
<figure id="attachment_179278" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179278" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-179278" src="https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/fig2-hrsg-heat-recovery-steam-generator-drew-robb.png" alt="HRSG-heat-recovery-steam-generator" width="720" height="442" srcset="https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/fig2-hrsg-heat-recovery-steam-generator-drew-robb.png 720w, https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/fig2-hrsg-heat-recovery-steam-generator-drew-robb-300x184.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-179278" class="wp-caption-text"><em>2. The primary elements of the HRSG are the superheater, the evaporator, and the economizer. Courtesy: SoftInWay</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are major differences in temperature across the HRSG. The economizer temperature is much lower than the superheater section. Water fed into the economizer is preheated and passed to the evaporator to be converted into steam. As the name suggests, the superheater is used to superheat the steam to be fed to the steam turbine.</p>
<p>When hydrogen blends are introduced into HRSGs that were designed for natural gas combustion, certain factors must be appreciated. Hydrogen is a much lighter molecule than methane. It has a lower Btu value per unit of volume—natural gas has about five times the heating value per unit of volume, which means a far larger volume of hydrogen is needed for the combustion process. This impacts piping and metering stations that feed the turbine.</p>
<p>“Hydrogen has a high mass related heating value of 51,600 Btu/pound, as well as a density that is eight times lower than methane,” said Saab.</p>
<p>The higher flame temperature of hydrogen (roughly 4,000F versus 3,600F) means NO<sub>x</sub> becomes more of an issue. Burners, too, may need to be modified.</p>
<h2>HRSG Modifications</h2>
<p>Burner companies such as John Zink Hamworthy will usually determine the best size for fuel injectors used in hydrogen service. Minor modifications may be needed to HRSG duct burners depending on the amount of hydrogen being introduced. Separate hydrogen valve trains and firing elements will also need to be installed due to differences in heating value and supply pressure (Figure 3).</p>
<figure id="attachment_179279" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179279" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-179279" src="https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/fig3-combined-cycle-power-plant-drew-robb.jpg" alt="combined-cycle-power-plant" width="720" height="540" srcset="https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/fig3-combined-cycle-power-plant-drew-robb.jpg 720w, https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/fig3-combined-cycle-power-plant-drew-robb-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-179279" class="wp-caption-text"><em>3. This plant is fired by refinery gas where the hydrogen in the fuel can range from about 30% to 80%, but is typically about 50%. The HRSG is coupled to a 22-MW gas turbine. Source: Archie Robb</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>“The presence of hydrogen is likely to reduce performance; this must be compensated for with better burners and some design modifications,” said Slepicka. “As a result, HRSG duct burners are likely to be more expensive than those used in natural gas-based HRSGs.”</p>
<p>Rentech has provided at least eight HRSGs to companies that want to burn hydrogen, primarily chemical plants that already have a ready supply on site. Some use it to produce more power, others for process steam.</p>
<p>“One had dedicated injectors as the pressure was lower,” said Slepicka. “The other was able to use existing injectors.”</p>
<p>He pointed out that the superheaters will run a little cooler due to all the water that condenses in the HRSG. This impacts heat transfer in the superheater. Hence, those driving a steam turbine may notice a performance hit compared to natural gas. This should be taken into account. If it is a new combined cycle plant, the steam turbine should be sized larger to generate the same amount of power as a 100% natural gas facility.</p>
<p>On the exhaust side, note that hydrogen requires a much higher volume of gas to be passed through the turbine. The HRSG, therefore, needs to be engineered to avoid exceeding the casing’s design pressure. Higher pressure drop can also be a factor in derated performance.</p>
<h2>Safety and Emissions Concerns</h2>
<p>The wider explosion range, lower ignition energy, and lightness of the hydrogen molecule compared to natural gas raises some safety concerns. Any unburned hydrogen will rise to the top of the HRSG and may collect in pockets. Modern HRSG designs generally leave little room for the collection of gas. However, purge cycles may be required to eliminate the risk of explosion. Any facility burning hydrogen should also install hydrogen detection technologies to catch the early signs of leakage.</p>
<p>Water and condensation are further issues. The water dewpoint rises when firing hydrogen. Therefore, cold parts of the HRSG in contact with exhaust gas will form condensation, especially in the back end of the HRSG. Designers should be aware of this phenomenon and ensure that drains and drying measures are implemented as needed.</p>
<p>As for emissions, the main worry is NO<sub>x</sub>. Early experience with hydrogen-based combustion and HRSGs indicates that NO<sub>x</sub> numbers will be higher due to the higher flame temperature of hydrogen. This will be negligible if hydrogen remains at 5% by volume of the overall fuel blend, said Slepicka. Above that, NO<sub>x</sub> will rise and mitigation steps will be needed.</p>
<p>SCR systems are already present in many HRSGs. Once the hot gases have moved through the HRSG and converted water to steam, they need to be mixed with ammonia before being released into the atmosphere to ensure emissions compliance.</p>
<h2>Hydrogen’s HRSG History</h2>
<p>Hydrogen, it turns out, is nothing new in packaged boilers and HRSGs. Packaged boilers have operated with some blend of hydrogen for decades. For example, <a href="https://www.powermag.com/port-arthur-ii-integrated-hydrogencogeneration-facility-port-arthur-texas/">Valero’s Port Arthur refinery in Texas</a>, which produces more than 100 million ft<sup>3</sup>/day of high-purity hydrogen, has added a combined cycle plant with a GE Frame 7EA 80-MW gas turbine. The HRSG is designed for supplemental duct firing up to 550,000 lb/hr and with a ramp rate of 60,000 lb/hr per minute. A steam methane reformer (SMR) hydrogen plant is integrated into the facility to provide additional steam. Exhaust from the gas turbines is used by the HRSG and the SMR. A 20-MW auto-extraction/backpressure steam turbine produces power and exports steam at two different pressures.</p>
<p>“In the coming years, HRSGs will be required to run with hydrogen in increasing frequency,” said Slepicka.</p>
<h2>Retrofit or Replace</h2>
<p>New HRSGs should always be designed to take into account the potential presence of hydrogen. Who wants to buy a HRSG and find out two years later than it requires extensive modification to tolerate hydrogen blends? Room for an SCR should be included as part of this. As emissions of NO<sub>x</sub> will go up as more hydrogen is added, space should be left in new HRSG designs where an SCR can be added in the future, if needed.</p>
<p>“Those wanting to burn hydrogen in the future should set up the HRSG for it upfront,” said Saab. “Those that do receive a hydrogen-ready stamp, that can help with financing and will minimize costs. It is far more difficult to do afterwards.”</p>
<p>But what about the hundreds of HRSGs that already exist? Some are decades old. To be able to operate with hydrogen blends, many will require substantial retrofitting to operate efficiently. Worst case scenario: it may be easier to replace an old HRSG with one specifically designed for hydrogen combustion. Particularly in light of the fact that gas turbine OEMs are intent on introducing more and more hydrogen into their turbines (with 100% being the ultimate goal), newer HRSGs should be specified to cope with hydrogen and older ones should be evaluated based on the best course between retrofit and replace.</p>
<p>“Retrofitting an SCR into existing HRSGs would be extremely challenging,” said Slepicka. “If an older HRSG needs a lot of modification, it might be better to replace it. In any case, many of these units are nearing end of life.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="left"><strong>CALGARY, Alberta, Oct. 17, 2022 –</strong> TC Energy Corp. announced today a $29.3 million investment in a renewable natural gas (RNG) production facility near the <a href="https://www.jackdaniels.com/en-us">Jack Daniel Distillery</a> in Lynchburg, Tennessee. Owned by Lynchburg Renewable Fuels LLC, the facility will produce RNG with a carbon intensity score that is 50% lower than traditional natural gas, saving up to 16,000 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>e/ year. The project is being developed by 3 Rivers Energy Partners, LLC, also an owner in Lynchburg Renewable Fuels.</p>
<p>Once operational in 2024, a byproduct of the Jack Daniel’s distilling process will be broken down to generate methane gases recovered as biogas. A biogas upgrade plant will remove contaminants to produce pipeline-quality RNG that will be directly connected to a local natural gas utility. Liquid fertilizer will also be produced in the process, processed, stored and distributed to meet local agriculture demand.</p>
<p>“This investment is our first in the production of renewable natural gas,” said Corey Hessen, TC Energy Executive Vice-President and President, Power &amp; Energy Solutions. “The production of RNG onsite at the Jack Daniel Distillery offers TC Energy one more opportunity to meet the challenge of growing energy needs and reducing emissions while providing customers with access to an affordable, reliable source of energy.”</p>
<p>TC Energy will market 100% of the RNG production and environmental attributes, which include renewable identification numbers and low carbon fuel standards.</p>
<p>“Our goal is to create lasting partnerships that give organizations the ability to create a sustainable future by utilizing bio-waste to reduce energy and help sustain local agriculture,” said John Rivers, CEO of 3 Rivers Energy Partners. “What we are doing is a major step for Jack Daniel’s, the local agriculture, and our planet’s future.”</p>
<p>TC Energy and 3 Rivers Energy Partners have also committed to jointly develop future RNG projects.</p>
<p>Since 2002, TC Energy has transported RNG with the current capacity to flow over 30 Bcf annually to market through 17 interconnects across its footprint of thousands of miles of pipelines. This investment marks the company’s first for producing RNG.</p>
<p>The announcement builds upon TC Energy’s ongoing development of its extensive low-carbon energy portfolio, most recently as the company commenced construction in October on <a href="https://www.tcenergy.com/announcements/2022-10-04-tc-energy-to-build-its-first-solar-energy-project-in-canada/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">an 81 MW solar facility in Alberta</a>.</p>

<p>BP on Oct. 17 said it was buying Houston, Texas-based Archaea Energy for $3.3 billion in cash, or $26 a share, along with $800 million for Archaea’s debt. The deal is subject to regulatory approvals and approval by Archaea’s shareholders, with the companies targeting the deal’s closing by year-end. Archaea will operate as a subsidiary within BP after the transaction closes, according to the companies.</p>
<p>“Archaea is a fantastic fast-growing business, and BP will add distinctive value through our trading business and customer reach,” said BP CEO Bernard Looney. “It will accelerate our key bioenergy growth engine, creating a real leader in the biogas sector, and support our net-ero ambition. And, importantly, we’re doing this while remaining focused on the disciplined execution of our financial frame. Investing with discipline into the energy transition, creating further value through integration—this is exactly what BP’s transformation into an integrated energy company is all about.”</p>
<h2>Largest RNG Deal to Date</h2>
<p>The deal is the largest to date in the RNG sector, surpassing Chevron’s $3.15 billion buyout of biodiesel maker Renewable Energy Group earlier this year. It’s BP’s largest acquisition since Looney took over as the company’s chief executive in early 2020. Looney at the time said he would grow BP’s renewable energy business and move to decarbonize the company’s operations, in part by cutting emissions from its oil and gas production sector.</p>

<p>RNG, also called biogas, is gas that is captured from organic waste in landfills or farms. Archaea operates 50 RNG and landfill gas-to-energy facilities across the U.S., and has a development pipeline of more than 80 projects. The company earlier this year announced a joint venture with Republic Services, a waste disposal group, to develop 40 RNG projects across the U.S. The groups said that joint venture will convert landfill gas into pipeline-quality RNG that can be used for a variety of applications to displace conventional natural gas.</p>

<p>BP has said it wants to substantially grow Archea’s RNG output. Looney said the expectation is to grow production at least fivefold by 2030, to about 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed). BP’s current biogas business produces about 11,000 boed.</p>
<h2>Biogas Investment</h2>
<p>Looney on Monday said biogas “is a product that our customers want,” as more groups—particularly transportation companies—use biogas as a lower-carbon fuel. &#8220;There’s more demand for this product today than there is supply,” Looney said, also noting that biogas sector is expected to grow “25 fold by 2050.” Looney said BP plans to invest $1.7 billion in its biogas business over the next five years.</p>
<p>“Archaea was founded with a mission to build the world’s leading RNG development company to reduce global emissions and make multi-generational sustainability impacts. In a very short period of time, we have rapidly become a leading RNG platform in the U.S., and today’s announcement will further enable this business to realize its full potential,” said Nick Stork, Archaea’s CEO and co-founder. “BP is a world-class partner and a strong fit for Archaea, with a strategic focus on bioenergy and an operational history in the RNG value chain that is fully aligned with ours and our partners’.”</p>
<p>Stork continued, “We are excited to join [BP] in our mission to increase the role of RNG in helping customers reach their long-term climate goals, and I look forward to our hard-working team joining the BP organization to help achieve their bioenergy objectives. I am incredibly proud of our employees at Archaea who have driven this tremendous value creation and will continue to push forward Archaea’s drive to foster clean energy growth and promote domestic energy reliance.”</p>
<p>Daniel Rice, Archaea’s board chairman, said, “After a thorough review, our board determined that combining Archaea’s RNG assets and our strong development backlog with BP’s existing bioenergy business and deep operational and financial resources is the best way to create a stronger platform to achieve Archaea’s full potential, while maximizing value for our shareholders. Today’s news would not be possible without the entire Archaea organization, our best-in-class employees and our industry partners.”</p>
<h2>Decarbonization</h2>
<p>The companies in a news release said the deal “provides Archaea access to unmatched, world-class platforms, capabilities, and capital resources for acceleration of its growth plans. Archaea’s business will be able to access BP’s trading capabilities and broad customer base, further helping many of BP’s customers achieve their decarbonization goals.” The groups said that Archaea “will be integral to BP’s existing bioenergy business, which has established key positions in the segment and is one of BP’s key transition growth engines, which is anticipated to further Archaea’s growth into international markets.”</p>
<p>BP officials have said the company expects to invest more than 40% of its total capital into its renewable energy and transition businesses by 2025. It expects to spend as much as $16 billion this year, and has said most of its capital expenditure will continue to go toward its oil and gas business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States and Canada are in a leadership position with carbon capture, utilization, and storage projects. The industry is developing rapidly due net zero goals and 45Q tax incentives, but companies face challenges with project staffing, equipment constraints, and regulatory permitting. Carbon capture and sequestration must reach gigaton scale in order to achieve net zero goals.</p>
<p><span class="legendSpanClass">HOUSTON</span>, <span class="legendSpanClass">Oct. 17, 2022</span> /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ &#8212; ALJ Group created the <a href="https://uscarboncaptureforum.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Carbon Capture Forum</a> after a successful event series for hydrogen and LNG. The carbon capture forum brought together industry experts on policy, funding, technology, and project execution.</p>
<p>Princeton University&#8217;s Net Zero America report expects carbon sequestration in the United States to increase to 1.5 gigatons by 2050 in a low electrification scenario and reach about 1 gigatons by 2050 in a high electrification scenario.</p>
<p>Todd Bush, the chairman of the event, opened the conference by stating, &#8220;In order to reach our net zero goals, we must get to gigaton scale for carbon capture. That is one billion metric tons of carbon sequestered per year. The United States and Canada have had the most success with carbon capture and storage with more demonstrations, more pilots, and more operational facilities to draw on lessons learned.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Decarbonfuse data, there are <a href="https://decarbonfuse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">75 projects in North America under development</a> including direct air capture, carbon sequestration, and blue hydrogen projects. Many of these projects expect to be operational in 2024 to 2026 presenting potential supply chain constraints for the industry.</p>
<p>Key points during the American Carbon Capture Forum were regulatory permitting, supply chain, and staffing challenges that face the industry.</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Primacy CO2 wells. North Dakota and Wyoming are the only states with primacy, so additional states competent with regulating injection wells will likely seek approval from the EPA to regulate CO2 sequestration wells at a state level. Likely states include Texas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Colorado, Oklahoma, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia.</li>
<li>Equipment constraints. Ramp up in projects will create constraints for compressors, absorbers, blowers, and other capture equipment. Industry leading EPCs such as Worley, McDermot, KBR, and Air Liquide commented that proper planning and collaboration with suppliers and vendors will be critical for delivering projects on time and on budget.</li>
<li>Project staffing. Increased project activity will also highlight staff and crew constraints according to top carbon capture engineering firms Kiewit, Black &amp; Veatch, and Flour. Each company described plans and techniques to overcome project staffing challenges to handle incoming project requests.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;ALJ Group is aware that it won&#8217;t be possible to get to net zero without advancing carbon capture, utilization and storage technologies and Texas has the potential to become a very important hub for that,&#8221; said Larry Keras, CEO of ALJ Group, organizers of the American Carbon Capture Forum.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://uscarboncaptureforum.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Carbon Capture Forum</a> is an annual event covering North America policy, projects, technology, and funding needed to grow the industry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>GREENVILLE, SC –October 11, 2022 – </strong>GE announced today the successful completion of the award negotiation phase for the company’s proposed project “<strong>Advanced Mixed Mode Combustor for </strong><strong>Hydrogen F-Class Retrofit</strong>.” GE will receive $6.6 million in federal funding from the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management to accelerate the transition towards a 100% hydrogen combustion future for its F-class gas turbines.  This funding will allow GE to develop and test breakthrough technologies to burn higher levels of hydrogen in its F-class gas turbine fleet, presently the company’s largest installed base with more than 1600 units in the world. GE Gas Power’s project was part of the six selected projects announced by the DOE on May 19, 2022, which also includes a <a href="https://www.ge.com/news/press-releases/ge-doe-accelerating-the-path-towards-100-hydrogen-combustion-in-gas-turbines">GE Research project</a> focused on the study of the operation of hydrogen-fueled turbine components.</p>
<p>GE received letters of support for this proposal from 10 US utility companies with an aggregate 240 gigawatts of total installed generation capacity serving approximately 81 million people across 39 states. GE also received a letter of support from a US-based independent, non-profit organization that conducts research and development related to power generation. These entities recognized the importance of developing gas turbine capabilities for power generation utilizing lower carbon fuels, such as hydrogen and hydrogen blends. Multiple utilities expressed interest in potentially contributing to technical reviews during the project period, while two other utilities expressed interest in potentially hosting future H2 projects with GE’s next generation H2 combustion technology.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“We are thankful for our customers’ recommending GE for this funding opportunity, in alignment with their respective carbon reduction visions, and grateful for the DOE’s commitment and investment in this project,” said Jeffrey Goldmeer, Emergent Technologies Director at GE Gas Power.  “Our objective is to develop and test a retrofittable F-Class staged combustor module with fuel capability ranging from 100% natural gas to levels up to 100% hydrogen. This award represents another key milestone in GE’s efforts to provide power plant operators with retrofit options that will allow them to transition their GE gas turbine F-class assets, the largest fleet installed in the U.S, generating approximately 60% of power in the country,  to operation on hydrogen resulting in lower CO2 emissions while maintaining NOx levels and overall gas turbine performance—positioning our customers for a lower-carbon future.”</p>
<p>As part of this program, the project team will address the challenges associated with highly reactive hydrogen combustion dynamics, starting with the study of micro mixer and axial fuel staging technologies. Both technologies, from the proven HA-Class combustion system, enable great load flexibility and have excellent premixing and operability over a range of fuels including up to 50% hydrogen. The concepts will be tested at the Center for Advanced Turbomachinery and Energy Research facility at the University of Central Florida and then validated at GE Gas Turbine Technology Laboratory in Greenville, South Carolina.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">GE, through its Gas Power business and Research Lab, brings a legacy of experience to the challenge of high hydrogen combustion. GE’s Gas Power engineering team in Greenville, SC and GE’s Research Lab in Niskayuna, NY offer a world-class combustion team with deep expertise and decades of hydrogen experience and fully capable build-and-test facilities for studying hydrogen combustion and flame characteristics.</p>
<p>Over the past years, GE has collaborated with DOE to research and develop combustion solutions for more sustainable power generation.  GE’s DLN2.6e combustion system that is standard on GE 9HA.01, 9HA.02 and 7HA.03 gas turbines was developed as part of the DOE’s High Hydrogen Turbine program.  This technology has enabled the DLN 2.6e combustion system to operate on blends of natural gas and hydrogen. Further, GE has a technology roadmap to achieve 100% hydrogen in this platform in the next decade. GE has more than eight million operating hours on hydrogen and similar low-BTU fuels from more than 100 units.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Madrid (Spain), October 6th, 2022 –</strong> The consortium comprising the companies COBRA, a company of the VINCI group, and SENER &#8211; with a 62% and 38% share, respectively &#8211; has signed with the client German LNG Terminal GmbH the EPC (Engineering, Procurement and Construction) contract for the Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) regasification terminal, which will be located in the German town of Brunsbüttel. This regasification terminal is a strategic project not only for the client but also for Germany as part of its energy transition process.</p>
<p>Located in the North of the country, at the mouth of the Elbe River in the North Sea, the regasification plant will have two 165,000-m3 storage tanks and the capacity to produce up to 8 BCMA (Billion Cubic Meters per Annum) of natural gas per year, which can be expanded to at least 10 BCMA. It will be equipped with two jetties, unloading arms, storage tanks, systems for regasification and gas emission, a BOG (Boil-off Gas) recovery system, a flare stack, auxiliary systems, and a series of buildings specially designed for the operations.</p>
<p>The terminal will provide various services: loading and unloading of carriers, storage of LNG, regasification, injection into the German natural gas grid and distribution of LNG via tankers and railway tanker wagons.</p>
<p>The new terminal will offer an alternative to the gas imported by land. In this respect, the company German LNG Terminal GmbH has indicated that this terminal “will make a significant contribution to the security of energy supply in Germany and Europe.”</p>
<p>This EPC contract is a continuation of the engineering work being carried out by the consortium comprising COBRA and SENER, evidencing the extensive experience of both actors in energy, oil and gas projects around the world. These include the design and construction of LNG terminals Sagunto and Bahía Bizkaia Gas (Spain), Gate terminal (Netherlands), Dunkerque (France) and Zeebrugge (Belgium).</p>
<p>The collaboration is worth a substantial investment and comprises a first tranche of preliminary work lasting around 9 to 15 months, with some construction work already taking place in parallel over a period of around 42 months. Under current conditions, it is realistic to expect completion in 2026. However, all parties involved are all working to further accelerate the project in compliance with all licensing and state aid requirements.</p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s4">The </span><span class="s1">Gulf SRC (GSRC) power plant, located about 130 kilometers (km) southeast of Bangkok, is the first gas-fired independent power project built by the two companies under their joint venture, Independent Power Development Co. (IPD). Gulf Energy Development holds a 70.0% equity interest in IPD, while Mitsui holds 30%. The first two 660-MW units at the GSRC plant went online in March 2021 and October 2021, respectively. The third and fourth units were completed this year despite COVID-related issues and supply chain constraints, said Mitsubishi Power, which delivered the plant under a full turnkey order. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Takashi Tozawa, deputy head of Energy Transition &amp; Power Headquarters, and senior general manager, for the GTCC Business Division at Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Mitsubishi Power’s parent company, noted the project was also completed “without incident” and “according to the original contract schedule.”</span></p>
<h2>Completion Achieved With 8,000 Actual Operating Hours</h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s5">Each of GSRC’s four power trains </span><span class="s1">comprises an M701JAC gas turbine, a steam turbine, a heat recovery steam generator, and a generator. “The first unit has already been in commercial operation for 1.5 years, the second unit for one year, and the third unit for six months—and all three boast high operating rates,” Mitsubishi Power said. “In September 2022, the M701JAC gas turbine of the first unit achieved 8,000 actual operating hours (AOH), establishing an industry benchmark of reliability.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Construction is meanwhile underway at a second 2,650-MW M701JAC power plant, the </span><span class="s5">Gulf PD (GPD) station,</span><span class="s1"> in Rayong province, about 176 km south of Bangkok. GSRC and GPD are a suite of independent power plants IPD was awarded in 2013. The GPD project in Rayong province is slated for completion in 2024, with Units 1 and 2 scheduled to come online in 2023. </span><span class="s4">Both the giant IPD projects have 25-year power purchase agreements with the </span><span class="s5">Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT), a state</span><span class="s6"> utility service enterprise managed by Thailand’s Ministry of Energy.</span></p>

<h2>Thailand Bracing for Solid Power Demand Growth</h2>
<p class="p5"><span class="s7">The two projects are part of a wave of independent power projects Thailand is building to meet growing demand for power, which is projected to surge as the country’s economy grows driven by a flourishing export sector. According to the Ministry of Energy’s </span><span class="s1">Energy Policy and Planning Office (EPPO), electricity demand from EGAT has increased at a compound average growth rate of 2.5% over the past decade—from 148,855 GWh in 2011 to 190,468 GWh in 2021. Thailand’s most recent power development plan projects the country’s power consumption will reach 367,458 GWh in 2037.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Thailand’s total contracted power generation capacity as of November 2021 was 50,894 MW, 31.5% generated by EGAT, and 30% by IPPs. Thailand is looking to add 56,431 MW to meet future demand and replace retiring power plants. Most of this new capacity—20,766 MW—will come from renewables, but the country envisions at least 15,096 MW from combined cycle power plants. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">While Thailand is <a href="https://www.eia.gov/international/overview/country/THA"><span class="s8">an oil and natural gas producer,</span></a> increasing gas demand from its power generation sector, industrial sector, and gas separation plants have pushed the country to ramp up the amount of liquefied natural gas (LNG) it imports. Gulf subsidiary Gulf LNG and an associate company HKH hold two of eight LNG shipper licenses issued by Thailand’s Energy Regulatory Commission. Gulf is also developing an LNG terminal, a project that it envisions will support Thailand in becoming a regional LNG hub. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">It <a href="https://www.gulf.co.th/en/pdf/onereport-gulf-2021-en.pdf"><span class="s8">says these businesses </span></a>will become a vital part of supplying fuel to Gulf’s power plants and strengthen the country’s energy security in the future. In total, Gulf operates, is building, or developing a 13.6-GW gas-fired power plant fleet. About 11 GW of that fleet are independent power plants in Thailand that will generate or sell power to EGAT. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s4">“</span><span class="s1">The company invests in the development, construction and operation of gas-fired power plants to support the growing electricity demand of the country, which is necessary for industrial and economic growth. Gas-fired power plant is a baseload power plant which can generate electricity steadily and continuously, and will be a bridge to the transition to a low-carbon society,” Gulf <a href="https://www.gulf.co.th/en/pdf/onereport-gulf-2021-en.pdf"><span class="s8">says</span></a>. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The company notes it has a “No Coal” policy and is striving to increase its investment in renewable energy. It also “prioritizes that use of state-of-the-art technology to allow projects to operate at the highest efficiency,” it says. </span></p>
