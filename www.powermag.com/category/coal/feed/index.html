										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States and Canada are in a leadership position with carbon capture, utilization, and storage projects. The industry is developing rapidly due net zero goals and 45Q tax incentives, but companies face challenges with project staffing, equipment constraints, and regulatory permitting. Carbon capture and sequestration must reach gigaton scale in order to achieve net zero goals.</p>
<p><span class="legendSpanClass">HOUSTON</span>, <span class="legendSpanClass">Oct. 17, 2022</span> /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ &#8212; ALJ Group created the <a href="https://uscarboncaptureforum.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Carbon Capture Forum</a> after a successful event series for hydrogen and LNG. The carbon capture forum brought together industry experts on policy, funding, technology, and project execution.</p>
<p>Princeton University&#8217;s Net Zero America report expects carbon sequestration in the United States to increase to 1.5 gigatons by 2050 in a low electrification scenario and reach about 1 gigatons by 2050 in a high electrification scenario.</p>
<p>Todd Bush, the chairman of the event, opened the conference by stating, &#8220;In order to reach our net zero goals, we must get to gigaton scale for carbon capture. That is one billion metric tons of carbon sequestered per year. The United States and Canada have had the most success with carbon capture and storage with more demonstrations, more pilots, and more operational facilities to draw on lessons learned.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Decarbonfuse data, there are <a href="https://decarbonfuse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">75 projects in North America under development</a> including direct air capture, carbon sequestration, and blue hydrogen projects. Many of these projects expect to be operational in 2024 to 2026 presenting potential supply chain constraints for the industry.</p>
<p>Key points during the American Carbon Capture Forum were regulatory permitting, supply chain, and staffing challenges that face the industry.</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Primacy CO2 wells. North Dakota and Wyoming are the only states with primacy, so additional states competent with regulating injection wells will likely seek approval from the EPA to regulate CO2 sequestration wells at a state level. Likely states include Texas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Colorado, Oklahoma, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia.</li>
<li>Equipment constraints. Ramp up in projects will create constraints for compressors, absorbers, blowers, and other capture equipment. Industry leading EPCs such as Worley, McDermot, KBR, and Air Liquide commented that proper planning and collaboration with suppliers and vendors will be critical for delivering projects on time and on budget.</li>
<li>Project staffing. Increased project activity will also highlight staff and crew constraints according to top carbon capture engineering firms Kiewit, Black &amp; Veatch, and Flour. Each company described plans and techniques to overcome project staffing challenges to handle incoming project requests.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;ALJ Group is aware that it won&#8217;t be possible to get to net zero without advancing carbon capture, utilization and storage technologies and Texas has the potential to become a very important hub for that,&#8221; said Larry Keras, CEO of ALJ Group, organizers of the American Carbon Capture Forum.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://uscarboncaptureforum.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Carbon Capture Forum</a> is an annual event covering North America policy, projects, technology, and funding needed to grow the industry.</p>

For example, Californians were asked to voluntarily reduce their electricity consumption for 10 days in a row in August. A few weeks later, the state’s grid operator issued another emergency alert: “Conserve energy now to protect public health and safety … Power interruptions may occur unless you take action.” In an interesting twist, a state that is increasing its reliance on electric vehicles (no new gasoline-powered vehicles by 2035) had to ask car owners to limit charging to help protect the state’s grid.</p>
<p>One of the major reasons for this self-inflicted electricity shortage is the state’s heavy reliance on solar and wind power combined with a lack of dispatchable sources of electricity to call on when the sun sets or the wind is not blowing. Last year, California relied on solar and wind for slightly more than 25% of its electricity; whereas, wind and solar provided 14% for the rest of the country. There is absolutely nothing wrong with wind and solar power, provided there are other sources of electricity that are not weather dependent and can be called on when needed.</p>
<p>Some see California as a leader because it is aggressively increasing wind and solar power and decarbonizing its electricity supply. California’s renewable portfolio standard (RPS) requires 60% renewables by 2030 and carbon-free electricity by 2045. Others see the state as a cautionary lesson in what can happen if the transition to renewables is too fast.</p>
<p>Impartial grid operators and regulators have been warning that the pace of the transition away from dispatchable fossil fuels and nuclear power to non-dispatchable wind and solar might be too fast. In its 2021 Long-Term Reliability Assessment, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), which evaluates risks to the bulk power system, warned that large sections of the country might face electricity shortfalls for the next 10 years due in part to the retirement of dispatchable resources that can run almost continuously and provide reliability attributes that wind and solar cannot.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, NERC’s warning did not take into account the massive number of coal power plants (more than 92,000 MW) that are expected to retire by the end of this decade. In fact, the amount of coal-fired capacity that has announced retirement is almost four times greater than the coal retirements (25,000 MW) that NERC used as the basis for its warning. In addition, new U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rules are expected to increase coal retirements even more, unless the EPA gives greater consideration to grid reliability as it develops new rules. However, the EPA estimates that its proposed Ozone Transport Rule will cause the retirement of 25,000 MW of coal-fired generating capacity, more than 10% of the existing coal fleet, by 2025. There are five other EPA rules that also could have a major impact on coal retirements and grid reliability.</p>
<p>While the retirement of conventional resources might be inevitable over the long term, we still have to allow time for retiring resources to be replaced with equally dependable resources. Taking the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) as an example, almost 29,000 MW of coal-fired capacity have announced plans to retire by 2030. However, only 21,000 MW of dispatchable resources are lined up in MISO’s interconnection queue, and it is a safe bet that some amount of this dispatchable capacity will never be built.</p>
<p>When electricity demand peaks, dispatchable resources (coal, gas, and nuclear) are five to six times more dependable than wind and twice as dependable as solar. Battery storage can improve the dependability of wind and solar power, but batteries are not as cost-effective as they need to be, which is one reason the grid transition needs to be gradual.</p>
<p>Another reason is the amount of time it takes to add new transmission lines that are necessary to deliver more wind and solar power to load centers. While the Inflation Reduction Act provides billions of dollars as an incentive to add transmission, money alone will not speed up transmission projects. Large transmission projects are taking more than a decade to build, and some are taking close to two decades. These delays are not due to lack of money, but rather NIMBY (not-in-my-backyard) opposition, planning delays, and permitting obstacles, in other words, bureaucracy and human nature.</p>
<p>The U.S. has more than 200,000 miles of electric transmission, but research from Princeton University projects that transmission will need to increase by 60% by 2030 and possibly triple to achieve President Biden’s goal of net-zero emissions by 2050. And yet, over the past decade, we have averaged just 1,800 miles of new transmission each year. At that rate, it would take more than 60 years to add the transmission that is needed in less than 10 years. Even though Congress and the administration are considering ways to streamline the transmission development process, it remains to be seen if those improvements will make enough of a difference.</p>
<p>Our polling in a large part of the U.S. shows that almost 60% of the public values reliability more than any other aspect of their electricity supply. That does not seem too surprising. Frankly, what did surprise us is that less than 10% consider wind and solar power to be their number one electricity priority. Let’s not lose sight of that as the grid evolves. Coal promotes reliability, but only if we have a coal fleet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Pilsen, Czech Republic (Oct. 10, 2022)</strong> – Pilsen-based steam turbine producer Doosan Škoda Power has signed a contract with the company Elektrárny Opatovice (EOP) to replace a TG3 steam turbine. The continuing upgrade is expected to improve the quality and reliability of heat and power supply and contribute to better environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Doosan Škoda Power won the contract in a tender process. Doosan Škoda Power’s experience in applications for steam-gas and fossil power plants, cogeneration, nuclear and solar power plants, biomass incineration plants, waste-to-energy plants, etc. played a key role in its success in the tender. “The upgrade of the entire TG3 heating plant was a challenge for us, particularly in terms of the complexity of the scope of the job and the power plant’s requirements for the technical design of the work. Following on the recent TG5 plant upgrade that we successfully completed for EOP, this work on TG3 is another significant commitment to the client,” says Tomáš Bayer, Sales Manager at Doosan Škoda Power.</p>
<p>Through the project, Doosan Škoda Power will supply a new state-of-the-art condensing steam turbine providing 65 MWe (megawatt electric) to 140 MWt (megawatt thermal), including all accessories such as control systems, a condenser, low pressure regenerative feedwater heating equipment, block transformer, oil management equipment, interconnecting piping, control system, high pressure hydraulic system, field equipment, etc.</p>
<p>TG3 is the second most important turbine for heat supplies after TG5. The refurbishment of the unit will take place as part of the planned turbine shutdown in 2023 and the turbine will become fully operational again in 2024. The planned 15% increase in efficiency will result in a positive environmental impact and reduced energy consumption.</p>
<p>“The upgrade will significantly increase the efficiency of combined heat and power generation,” says Stanislav Ondráček, Head of Strategic Development at EOP, adding that the project is one of key upgrade projects at the plant in addition to the planned decarbonisation and switch to natural gas, and will thus play a key role in combined heat and power generation.</p>
<p>The Opatovice Power Plant is an important producer of electricity and heat in the East Bohemia region. It supplies heat to nearly 63,000 customers in Pardubice, Hradec Králové, Chrudim and other towns and villages in the region.</p>

Meanwhile, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law seeks to remedy environmental issues caused by inadequate regulation within the oil and gas industry.</p>
<p>The push for the use of renewable energy in the U.S. has created a legislative imbalance across the country. With any new initiative, legislation to regulate industry can be slow and ad hoc. Non-renewable energy, such as nuclear energy, coal, and oil, have been used for centuries, and the industry has become one of the most highly regulated. However, legislation for the decommissioning of plants utilizing these forms of energy has proven to be abysmal.</p>
<h2>Nuclear and Coal Power Plant Decommissioning</h2>
<p>The decommissioning process occurs at the end of plant life after operations cease. The process of decommissioning for non-renewable energy varies, with nuclear plants being the most highly regulated. The regulation for the decommissioning of a nuclear plant is outlined by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and may occur using one of three strategies. These are DECON, immediate dismantling soon after the plant closes; SAFSTOR, often considered “deferred dismantling,” which involves maintaining and monitoring the facility to allow radioactivity to decay over decades; or ENTOMB, contaminants are permanently encased onsite in a material such as concrete. Additionally, to ensure that the decommissioning takes place, the NRC ensures that licensees of sites have sufficient funds for decommissioning with a reporting mechanism in place every two years. Regulation of nuclear sites is crucial, as there could be catastrophic implications for the people and environment, if performed inadequately.</p>
<p>Decommissioning of coal-fired power plants is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Coal-fired power plant decommissioning is not as stringent as a nuclear plant, and involves cleanup and waste removal, remediation, and redevelopment. Many of these plants are retired but have yet to be cleaned up, remediated, and redeveloped because of the sheer cost of carrying out the venture. Instead, many entities seek to sell these plants as-is to an investor with deep pockets that has the wherewithal to remediate and redevelop them in accordance with EPA guidelines.</p>
<p>The funding for coal plant decommissioning costs is largely based on whether the facility is located in a regulated or deregulated state. In deregulated states, such as Pennsylvania, there is no state or federal protection to ensure that there is adequate funding for decommissioning. The cost of decommissioning is included in the cost of doing business. Coal plants can sit for years after shutdown without remediation, such as the 236-acre Hatsfield Ferry Plant, retired in 2013 but demolition and restoration will not be completed until 2024. However, in regulated markets across the U.S., decommissioning is paid by the ratepayer after the utility company provides cost estimates on a recurring basis and regulators approve the expenses. Delays in decommissioning can have negative impacts on the environment and community as a plant sits idle.</p>
<h2>Funding Problems for Oil and Gas Site Decommissioning</h2>
<p>Oil and gas decommissioning, similar to coal-fired plants, is also plagued with abandoned wells that were improperly done, exposing residents to potential pollution that can leach into the soil. Decommissioning of oil wells involves dismantling the facility, plugging and abandoning the well, and restoring the site to its original condition. According to an investigation done by Reuters in 2020, America has more than 3.2 million unplugged abandoned wells, with Pennsylvania having more than 200,000 of those wells.</p>
<p>Federal regulation only governs 10% of the drilling that takes place within the U.S., according to the American Petroleum Institute, while the other 90% takes place on privately owned land governed by state laws and regulations. Many state regulations have proven to be woefully inadequate to cover the costs associated with decommissioning. For example, Texas administrative code requires only a $250,000 performance bond, letter of credit, or cash for 100 or more wells, while the average cost to plug a well ranges from $20,000 to $145,000, according to a Government Accountability Office report focused on the risks associated with insufficient bonds to reclaim wells.</p>
<p>Oil and gas companies have successfully escaped liability due to insufficient bonds, and many at the end of retirement of facilities are bankrupt with the state being left with the financial burden. According to Haynes and Boone LLP, there were 61 oil field service companies that filed for bankruptcy in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Taxpayers have been left bearing the decommissioning liability, while oil and gas entities have eked out all profits from the wells. This resulted in lobbying efforts to have the federal government step in and remedy the situation by providing funding. In January 2022, the Department of the Interior received $1.5 billion through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to commence the plugging and capping of abandoned oil and gas wells, and awarded $560 million to 24 states, including West Virginia and Mississippi, for plugging of wells in August 2022.</p>
<h2>Modern Approach to Decommissioning</h2>
<p>In the age of renewable energy, one could only hope that legislators have learned from the horrors experienced in the decommissioning of non-renewable sites. Many first-generation solar and wind facilities are coming to an end with the average life of panels and turbines ranging from 25 years to 35 years. Like fossil fuels, there is ad hoc legislation relating to the decommissioning of renewable facilities.</p>
<p>Decommissioning of solar panels and wind turbines includes the removal of all panels or turbines, structures, foundations, fencing, roads, and restoring the property to the previous condition. Unlike fossil fuels, remediation is not considered in decommissioning, as many of the panels are recyclable and there is only an issue of environmental contamination if high quantities of lead and cadmium are present.</p>
<p>The federal government, through the Bureau of Land Management, and 19 states have decommissioning legislation for renewable facilities. Pennsylvania is in the process of debating decommissioning legislation. The lack of decommissioning regulations in most states is surprising, as the federal government had to rescue states to plug oil and gas wells. Without adequate decommissioning policies, landowners—mainly in rural areas—could be left with the financial burden of removing the panels.</p>
<p>Most decommissioning legislation has the lessee of the solar farm delivering evidence of financial assurance that it will be able to complete the decommissioning of the site after the useful life of the equipment. The assurance is usually based on the total acreage being used for the solar or wind facility, less the salvaged value.</p>
<p>Although finalizing regulations for decommissioning of renewable energy sites is slow, many of these facilities are not yet retired. Therefore, states have the ability to enact legislation prior to the retirement of wind and solar farms, leading many states to avoid the failures of non-renewable legislation.</p>

The systems are expected to be fully operational by the end of this year. In addition, Saft Flex’ion batteries will support a microgrid powered by hydroelectric and solar plants, as well as diesel generation, on the island of Ustica. The batteries will be connected to the distribution network and integrated into a smart grid. The installations are the first pieces of the “I-Sole project,” which involves local utilities as well as scientific expertise from the University of Palermo and the Italian National Research Council. The project is supported financially by the European Union and the Region of Sicily, under the technical lead of Layer Electronics, a local power electronics company. The I-Sole project aims to develop innovative technical solutions for monitoring and control of power generation and distribution, with a focus on increasing the use of renewable sources and storage systems on small Sicilian islands while supporting the security of power supply. Flex’ion batteries are assembled in Saft’s Raskovice factory, in the Czech Republic, using lithium-ion cells manufactured in Saft’s Nersac factory in France.</p>
<p><strong>Financing Closed on Polish Solar Plant.</strong> An agreement was reached at the end of August among ib vogt, BayernLB, and Siemens Financial Services for a solar farm already under construction in Poland. The facility is expected to come online early next year. The three groups together are financing the $90 million project, which will have 135 MW of generation capacity. The plant is located near the towns of Zamosc and Szczebrzeszyn in the Lublin voivodeship, or regional area, in the southeast of Poland. Officials said the project is sited in an area with high solar irradiation and low-quality soil, and will feature more than 250,000 solar panels. CMS Poland provided legal advice for construction of the project. Wind Prospect Polska provided technical advice, and Marsh Poland served as insurance adviser. ib vogt, which is headquartered in Berlin, Germany, is the engineering, procurement, and construction lead for the solar farm, and will continue to provide operations and maintenance services after the plant is commissioned. The project has an agreement with Next Kraftwerke to the trading of the project’s electricity on the Polish exchange.</p>
<p><strong>‘Hydrogen-Ready’ Gas Plant Announced for Singapore.</strong> Keppel, an infrastructure conglomerate working in the energy sector, in early September said it has made a final investment decision to build a 600-MW “hydrogen-ready” natural gas-fired facility in Singapore. Keppel officials said the plant would initially be powered by natural gas, but would be designed to eventually run on 100% hydrogen. The Keppel Sakra Cogeneration Plant, scheduled to come online in 2026, would be a combined cycle plant “designed to operate on fuels with 30% hydrogen content and has the capability of shifting to run entirely on hydrogen,” according to officials with the Singapore-based company. Keppel said the plant would utilize Mitsubishi Power JAC-series gas turbines, which at present can only accommodate a fuel mix of up to 30% hydrogen. Keppel officials had not addressed whether the original turbines would be replaced at a future time to burn a higher percentage of hydrogen.</p>
<p><strong>British Group Will Produce Green Hydrogen in Egypt.</strong> Globeleq, a British independent power producer, has received approval from Egyptian officials to produce green hydrogen and derivatives in the Suez Canal Economic Zone. Globeleq said it is looking at a 3.6-GW electrolysis plant. Globeleq signed the agreement with the New and Renewable Energy Authority, the Suez Canal Economic Zone General Authority, the Egyptian Sovereign Wealth Fund for Investment and Development, and the Egyptian Electricity Transmission Co. Globeleq under the terms of the agreement would develop, finance, build, and operate the electrolysis plant, which will produce hydrogen from electricity generated from wind and solar farms. Globeleq said the project will be built in several phases. An initial pilot phase will have an electrolysis capacity of 100 MW. The hydrogen produced will be converted into green ammonia, a needed ingredient for the production of fertilizer. Globeleq also said it plans to produce other hydrogen-derived fuels, including e-methanol, obtained by mixing carbon dioxide and hydrogen.</p>
<p><strong>Rolls-Royce Will Develop SMR Technology in the Netherlands.</strong> The nuclear power group Rolls-Royce SMR in August announced an agreement with ULC-Energy BV, a Dutch nuclear energy development company, to collaborate on the deployment of Rolls-Royce small modular reactor (SMR) power plants in the Netherlands. ULC-Energy is based in Amsterdam. The company is a newcomer to the energy sector—it was established in 2021—and has quickly taken the lead in nuclear power development in the Netherlands. ULC-Energy has said nuclear is important to support decarbonization. It plans to develop projects that would use nuclear power to support industrial and residential energy networks. The Netherlands’ new coalition government late last year said nuclear power would be paramount in its energy policy with regard to combating climate change. Officials outlined a multi-year plan, committing $50 million to the program in 2023, $200 million in 2024, and $250 million in 2025. The government said it expects cumulative financial support for nuclear will hit $5 billion by the end of the decade. Rolls-Royce SMR’s current design is a 470-MWe unit based on pressurized water reactor technology.</p>
<p><strong>Norway-Based Group Obtains Permit for South African Solar Project.</strong> Magnora, a Norwegian energy company, in August said it had received an environmental permit for a solar project the group is developing in South Africa. The 260-MW project is being designed to include a battery energy storage system. Oslo-based Magnora in a statement said, “The environmental clearance means that the project has the majority of the most important permits.” Magnora said the solar farm, whose specific location was not disclosed, is being built “in an area with extremely good solar radiation,” with an expected annual production of more than 600 GWh.</p>

On the one hand, the country has moved to embrace clean energy in the past few years, with renewables growing to 29% of total generation in 2021, after stagnating at about 10% through the 1990s and 2000s. Meanwhile, in June, Australia’s newly elected Labor government greatly increased the country’s target for cutting carbon emissions, and projected renewables would rise to 82% of generation. The country also has been a hotbed for innovative clean energy projects, like the Distributed Energy Resources (DER) Marketplace from the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), and projects that pair solar and storage in a way that enables remote areas to wean themselves off fossil fuels.</p>
<p>However, Australia also remains heavily dependent on coal, relying on it for more than half of its energy generation in 2021. Coal continues to be a major contributor to the economy. Australia is one of the world’s biggest exporters of coal, and it’s one of the most fossil fuel–reliant advanced economies. Up until this year’s election, the country’s affinity for coal often acted as a handbrake for its clean energy efforts, and concerns about deindustrialization and job losses limited the public’s appetite for turning away from coal too quickly.</p>
<p>As the election in May shows, the political tides in Australia have shifted to favor the clean energy transition, which will necessitate an acceleration in the decommissioning of coal plants to meet the new government’s aggressive emissions targets. Besides the shifting political winds in Canberra, a winter of electricity woes has also brought attention to the pitfalls of Australia’s reliance on coal, particularly in the eastern states of New South Wales (NSW is home to Sydney and a third of Australians) and Queensland.</p>
<p>Flooding at coal mines in the two states limited production, while technical issues and scheduled maintenance combined to knock out a quarter of Australia’s coal capacity. The issues with coal generation, the spike in energy prices this year, and increased demand as the Australian winter sets in, forced AEMO to temporarily suspend the country’s wholesale electricity market, electing to instead set prices directly to avoid price gouging.</p>
<p>“Though Australia’s coal plants suffered unexpected challenges this year, the impacts highlighted the pitfalls of the journey in transitioning from coal; physical dispatch requirements are changing and there is growing misalignment of market incentives,” said Patrick Lee, president and CEO of PXiSE Energy Solutions, a company that has worked on projects in Australia for years. “Energy storage and grid control software can help the country gradually decommission coal plants in a way that doesn’t shock the grid—something the Australian government and the country’s utilities have recognized, and the embrace of modern grid solutions demonstrates their smart approach to the transition to clean energy resources.”</p>
<p>Origin Energy, a major Australian power company, earlier this year said it would close Australia’s largest coal-fired power plant in 2025, seven years ahead of the scheduled shutdown date. “The reality is the economics of coal-fired power stations are being put under increasing, unsustainable pressure by cleaner and lower-cost generation, including solar, wind, and batteries,” Origin Energy Chief Executive Frank Calabria said in a statement. Origin plans to install a battery energy storage system (BESS), with as much as 700 MW of capacity, at the Eraring power station site, located about 75 miles north of Sydney. Origin said it plans to have the BESS mostly in place prior to decommissioning the 2,880-MW coal-fired facility, integrating the battery storage with renewable energy developments across NSW by 2026. Origin said the site also could be home to other energy projects over time that can utilize the existing power transmission lines.</p>
<p>Calabria said Origin is confident that its plans for new gas-fired power plants, pumped hydro stations, and BESS installations “will be more than enough to compensate for the exit of Eraring.” Origin’s strategy is likely to be followed by other Australian generators.</p>
<p>Canberra’s new aggressive emissions target, and the worsening effects of the climate crisis, are reasons enough for Australia to ramp up the decommissioning of its coal plants. The issues with coal plants in NSW and Queensland further highlight the need for the country to bring replacement energy production resources online quickly. Though unexpected, the various factors leading to coal’s price surge and technical problems related to aging coal plant infrastructure may happen again in years to come, and could again coincide with a surge in demand and scheduled maintenance.</p>

<p>AGL Energy, another Australian power group, earlier this year estimated it will cost more than $970 million to replace its Liddell coal-fired plant in the Hunter Valley mining region of NSW. AGL plans to close the Liddell plant (Figure 1) next year, and already has begun a phased shutdown of the station’s four 500-MW units. The company said it wants to add a 500-MW BESS, along with renewable energy resources, a gas-fired peaker plant, pumped-hydro storage, and a synchronous condenser at the site. Hunter Valley also will be home to the Hunter Energy Hub, a planned development featuring a grid-scale battery, solar thermal storage, wind power, hydrogen production, and pumped-hydro storage.</p>
<p>Renewable resources are well-positioned to fill in the demand gap caused by the decline in coal generation. Solar is the best option for Australia; the sunny country with a sparsely populated desert interior has the highest solar radiation per square meter of any continent. The country’s utilities and regulators have realized this, with solar power having a big increase in recent years.</p>
<p>However, Australia is still a far way off from being able to fully rely on renewables, as the electricity troubles of the past few months demonstrated. While this year’s energy crisis is accelerating the adoption of renewables, it will still be many years before enough solar and other renewable projects are brought into the wholesale energy market to match coal generation.</p>

<p>On the upside, the clean energy transition is highlighting technologies that can help Australia as the country decommissions its coal plants. Energy storage (Figure 2) will be increasingly important so that intermittent renewables can be an effective replacement for dispatchable fossil fuel energy. But energy storage also is key for the gradual decommissioning of coal plants. Operators can add storage to existing coal plants so that they can operate at financially reasonable levels of generation while grid operators prepare to offset the loss in coal generation. These plants will still be decommissioned, but in a manner that doesn’t cause a shock to the grid, a pressing concern as closures come years earlier than planned due to market conditions. Australia can still meet its clean energy goals with more gradual shutdowns of coal plants, but without also destabilizing the grid.</p>
<p>Decommissioned coal plants are also a prime site for energy storage because they already possess the infrastructure needed to connect batteries to the grid. Power producers and regulators are recognizing former coal plants for their energy storage potential. These efforts are likely to be ramped up, and more decommissioned coal sites are expected to be used for energy storage for Australia to fully meet demand with renewables.</p>
<p>In concert with energy storage, smart software solutions can assist Australia’s energy transition as coal plants retire. Grid control software like distributed energy management systems (DERMs) and microgrid controllers give utilities and operators the tools they need to maximize their renewable assets and energy storage. Such autonomous solutions use artificial intelligence to analyze historical demand and usage patterns, develop optimized asset usage plans, and then match them in real time to current grid conditions, updated weather forecasts, and predicted demand.</p>
<p>These software-based solutions can help Australia aggregate the thousands of incremental local contributions of DERs into meaningful impacts on the grid that reduce reliance on centralized generation sources. Plus, built-in optimization functions automatically shape, shift, and redistribute power, virtually eliminating power waste, and thereby requiring less generation and capacity to serve the same network needs.</p>
<p>Australia has already realized the benefits of assets like distributed energy, battery storage, and grid control software. For instance, rural communities in Western Australia, far from main grid connections, are hosting novel projects that pair storage and solar to take the place of fossil fuels. One of these has demonstrated that it’s possible for a microgrid to remain fully operational solely using renewables, without spinning generation.</p>
<p>In more densely populated areas, the country is embracing DER marketplaces to create local and wholesale markets for renewable energy, and operators have already realized the benefit of using old coal sites for energy storage. Australia has demonstrated the need to accelerate coal plant decommissioning, and also is demonstrating how it can repurpose those sites as it transitions to renewable energy.</p>

During its 140-year history, the magazine’s pages have reflected the fast-changing evolution of the technologies and markets that characterize the world’s power sector. These are some of the events that have shaped both the history of power and the history of POWER.</strong></em></p>
<p>The history of power generation is long and convoluted, marked by myriad technological milestones, conceptual and technical, from hundreds of contributors. Many accounts begin power’s story at the demonstration of electric conduction by Englishman Stephen Gray, which led to the 1740 invention of glass friction generators in Leyden, Germany. That development is said to have inspired Benjamin Franklin’s famous experiments, as well as the invention of the battery by Italy’s Alessandro Volta in 1800, Humphry Davy’s first effective “arc lamp” in 1808, and in 1820, Hans Christian Oersted’s demonstration of the relationship between electricity and magnetism. In 1820, in arguably the most pivotal contribution to modern power systems, Michael Faraday and Joseph Henry invented a primitive electric motor, and in 1831, documented that an electric current can be produced in a wire moving near a magnet—demonstrating the principle of the generator.</p>
<p>Invention of the first rudimentary dynamo is credited to Frenchman Hippolyte Pixii in 1832. Antonio Pacinotti improved it to provide continuous direct-current (DC) power by 1860. In 1867, Werner von Siemens, Charles Wheatstone, and S.A. Varley nearly simultaneously devised the “self-exciting dynamo-electric generator.” Perhaps the most important improvement then arrived in 1870, when a Belgian inventor, Zenobe Gramme, devised a dynamo that produced a steady DC source well-suited to powering motors—a discovery that generated a burst of enthusiasm about electricity’s potential to light and power the world.</p>
<p>By 1877—as the streets of many cities across the world were being lit up by arc lighting (but not ordinary rooms because arc lights were still blindingly bright)—Ohio-based Charles F. Brush had developed and begun selling the most reliable dynamo design to that point, and a host of forward thinkers were actively exploring the promise of large-scale electricity distribution. Eventually, Thomas Edison invented a less powerful incandescent lamp in 1879, and in September 1882—only a month before the inaugural issue of <i>POWER</i> magazine was published—he established a central generating station at Pearl Street (Figure 1) in lower Manhattan.</p>

<h2>A History Rooted in Coal</h2>
<p>Advances in alternating-current (AC) technology opened up new realms for power generation (see sidebar “Tesla and the War of the Currents”). Hydropower, for example, marked several milestones between 1890 and 1900 in Oregon, Colorado, Croatia (where the first complete multiphase AC system was demonstrated in 1895), at Niagara Falls, and in Japan.</p>

<td class="photocaption">
<h2><b>Tesla and the War of the Currents</b></h2>
<p>Today, most people recognize the name Tesla as a company that makes electric vehicles, but the real genius behind the name is not Elon Musk—it’s the Serbian-American engineer and physicist Nikola Tesla. Tesla, for all intents and purposes, was the man who pioneered today’s modern alternating-current (AC) electricity supply system.</p>
<p>Tesla was born in 1856 in Smiljan, Croatia, which was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire at the time. He studied math and physics at the Technical University of Graz in Austria, and also studied philosophy for a time at the University of Prague in what is now the Czech Republic. In 1882, he moved to Paris and got a job repairing direct-current (DC) power plants with the Continental Edison Co. Two years later, he immigrated to the U.S., where he became a naturalized citizen in 1889.</p>
<p>Upon arrival in the U.S., Tesla found a job working for Thomas Edison in New York City, which he did for about a year. Edison was reportedly impressed by Tesla’s skill and work ethic, but the two men were much different in their methods and temperament. Tesla solved many problems through visionary revelations; whereas, Edison relied more on practical experiments and trial-and-error. Furthermore, Tesla believed strongly that AC electrical systems were more practical for large-scale power delivery; whereas, Edison championed DC systems in what has since come to be known as the “War of the Currents.”</p>
<p>Tesla left Edison’s company following a payment dispute over one of Tesla’s dynamo improvements. After his departure, Tesla struggled for a time to find funding to start his own business. When he finally did get his company going, Tesla moved quickly, and over the span of about two years he was granted more than 30 patents for his inventions, which included a whole polyphase system of AC dynamos, transformers, and motors.</p>
<p>Word of Tesla’s innovative ideas spread, leading to an invitation for him to speak before the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. It was here that Tesla caught the eye of George Westinghouse, another AC power pioneer. Soon thereafter, Westinghouse bought the rights to Tesla’s patents and momentum for AC systems picked up.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important battle in the War of the Currents occurred in 1893 during the World’s Columbian Exposition, the official name of the World’s Fair that year, held in Chicago, Illinois. Westinghouse’s company won the bid over Edison’s company to power the fair with electricity, and it did so with Tesla’s polyphase system.</p>
<p>Among the exhibits (Figure 2) displayed at the fair were a switchboard, polyphase generators, step-up transformers, transmission lines, step-down transformers, industrial-sized induction motors and synchronous motors, rotary DC converters, meters, and other auxiliary devices. The demonstration allowed the public to see what an AC power system could look like and what it would be capable of doing. The fact that power could be transmitted over long distances, and utilized even to supply DC systems, opened many peoples’ eyes to the benefits it could provide and spurred movement toward a nationwide AC-powered grid.</p>

<p>In addition to his electrical inventions, Tesla also experimented with X-rays, gave short-range demonstrations of radio communication, and built a radio-controlled boat that he demonstrated for spectators, among other things. Although Tesla was quite famous and respected in his day, he was never able to capture long-term financial success from his inventions. He died in 1943 at the age of 86.</td>

<p>By then, however, coal power generation’s place in power’s history had already been firmly established. The first coal-fired steam generators provided low-pressure saturated or slightly superheated steam for steam engines driving DC dynamos. Sir Charles Parsons, who built the first steam turbine generator (with a thermal efficiency of just 1.6%) in 1884, improved its efficiency two years later by introducing the first condensing turbine, which drove an AC generator.</p>
<p>About a decade later, in 1896, American inventor Charles Curtis offered an invention of a different turbine to the General Electric Co. (GE). By 1901, GE had successfully developed a 500-kW Curtis turbine generator, which employed high-pressure steam to drive rapid rotation of a shaft-mounted disk, and by 1903, it delivered the world’s first 5-MW steam turbine to the Commonwealth Edison Co. of Chicago. Subsequent models, which received improvement boosts suggested by GE’s Dr. Sanford Moss, were used mostly as mechanical drives or as peaking units.</p>
<p>By the early 1900s, coal-fired power units featured outputs in the 1 MW to 10 MW range, outfitted with a steam generator, an economizer, evaporator, and a superheater section. By the 1910s, the coal-fired power plant cycle was improved even more by the introduction of turbines with steam extractions for feedwater heating and steam generators equipped with air preheaters—all which boosted net efficiency to about 15%.</p>
<p>The demonstration of pulverized coal steam generators at the Oneida Street Station in Wisconsin in 1919 vastly improved coal combustion, allowing for bigger boilers (Figure 3). In the 1920s, another technological boost came with the advent of once-through boiler applications and reheat steam power plants, along with the Benson steam generator, which was built in 1927. Reheat steam turbines became the norm in the 1930s, when unit ratings soared to a 300-MW output level. Main steam temperatures consistently increased through the 1940s, and the decade also ushered in the first attempts to clean flue gas with dust removal. The 1950s and 1960s were characterized by more technical achievements to improve efficiency—including construction of the first once-through steam generator with a supercritical main steam pressure.</p>

<p>Unit ratings of 1,300 MW were reached by the 1970s. In 1972, the world’s first integrated coal gasification combined cycle power plant—a 183-MW power plant for the German generator STEAG—began operations. Mounting environmental concerns and the subsequent passage of the Clean Air Act by the Nixon administration in the 1970s, however, also spurred technical solutions such as scrubbers to mitigate sulfur dioxide emissions. The decade ended with completion of a pioneering commercial fluidized bed combustion plant built on the Georgetown University campus in Washington, D.C., in 1979.</p>
<p>The early 1980s, meanwhile, were marked by the further development of emissions control technologies, including the introduction of selective catalytic reduction systems as a secondary measure to mitigate nitrogen oxide emissions. Component performance also saw vast improvements during that period to the 21st century. Among the most recent major milestones in coal power’s history is completion of the first large-scale coal-fired power unit outfitted with carbon capture and storage technology in 2014 at Boundary Dam in Saskatchewan, Canada (see sidebar “The 2010s Marked Extraordinary Change for Power”).</p>

<h2><b>The 2010s Marked Extraordinary Change for Power</b></h2>
<p>Every one of the 13 decades that <em>POWER</em> magazine has been in print has been definitive for electric generation technology, policy, and business in some significant way, but few have been as transformative as the 2010s. The decade opened just as the global economy began to crawl toward recovery from a historically unprecedented downturn that had bludgeoned industrial production and sent global financial markets into chaos.</p>
<p>The ensuing social consciousness fueled an environmental movement, which policymakers championed. Heightened concerns about climate change—driven by a globally embraced urgency to act—propelled energy transformations across the world, resulting in a clear shift in power portfolios away from coal and toward low- or zero-carbon resources. That shift has come with concerted emphasis on flexibility. Effecting a notable cultural change, the decarbonization movement has been championed by power company shareholders and customers, and some of the biggest coal generators in the world have announced ambitions to go net-zero by mid-century.</p>
<p>However, the shift has also benefited from a hard economic edge. Transformations, for example, have been enabled by technology innovations that cracked open a vast new realm of natural gas supply, sent the prices of solar panels and batteries plummeting, and made small-scale decentralized generation possible, while the uptake of digitalization has soared, mainly to prioritize efficiency gains.</p>
<p>Disruption continues to define the power industry today. The chaotic global pandemic that jolted the world in 2020 unfolded into a precarious set of energy crises in 2021. After a cold snap prompted mass generation outages across a swath of the central U.S., most prominently in Texas, volatile energy markets and power supply vulnerabilities jacked-up turmoil in California, China, India, and across Europe and Latin America. In 2022, Russia’s occupation of Ukraine and its economic war with the West prompted a new set of energy security concerns that have remained pitted against power affordability and sustainability interests.</td>

<h2>Gas Power Takes Off</h2>
<p class="04Body1stPara">Coal power technology’s evolution was swift owing to soaring power demand and a burgeoning mining sector. The natural gas power sector, which today takes the lion’s share of both U.S. installed capacity and generation, was slower to take off. Although the essential elements of a gas turbine engine were first patented by English inventor John Barber in 1791, it took more than a century before the concepts were really put to practical use.</p>
<p class="04Body">In 1903, Jens William Aegidius Elling, a Norwegian engineer, researcher, and inventor, built the first gas turbine to produce more power than was needed to run its own components. Elling’s first design used both rotary compressors and turbines to produce about 8 kW. He further refined the machine in subsequent years, and by 1912, he had developed a gas turbine system with separate turbine unit and compressor in series, a combination that is still common today.</p>
<p class="04Body">Gas turbine technology continued to be enhanced by a number of innovative pioneers from various countries. In 1930, Britain’s Sir Frank Whittle patented a design for a jet engine. Gyorgy Jendrassik demonstrated Whittle’s design in Budapest, Hungary, in 1937. In 1939, a German Heinkel HE 178 aircraft flew successfully with an engine designed by Hans von Ohain that used the exhaust from a gas turbine for propulsion. The same year, Brown Boveri Co. installed the first gas turbine used for electric power generation in Neuchatel, Switzerland. Both Whittle’s and von Ohain’s first jet engines were based on centrifugal compressors.</p>
<p>Innovations in aircraft technology, and engineering and manufacturing advancements during both World Wars propelled gas power technology to new heights, however. At GE, for example, engineers who participated in development of jet engines put their know-how into designing a gas turbine for industrial and utility service. Following development of a gas turbine-electric locomotive in 1948, GE installed its first commercial gas turbine for power generation—a 3.5-MW heavy-duty unit—at the Belle Isle Station owned by Oklahoma Gas &amp; Electric in July 1949 (Figure 4). Some experts point out that because that unit used exhaust heat for feedwater heating of a steam turbine unit, it was essentially also the world’s first combined cycle power plant. That same year, Westinghouse put online a 1.3-MW unit at the River Fuel Corp. in Mississippi.</p>

<p class="04Body">Large heavy-duty gas turbine technology rapidly improved thereafter. In the early 1950s, firing temperatures were 1,300F (705C), by the late 1950s, they had soared to 1,500F, and eventually reached 2,000F in 1975. By 1957, a general surge in gas turbine unit sizes led to the installment of the first heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) for a gas turbine. By 1965, the first fully fired boiler combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power plant came online, and by 1968, the first CCGT was outfitted with a HRSG. The late 1960s, meanwhile, was characterized by gas turbine suppliers starting to develop pre-designed or standard CCGT plants. GE developed the STAG (steam and gas) system, for example, Westinghouse, the PACE (Power at combined efficiency) system, and Siemens, the GUD (gas and steam) system.</p>
<p class="04Body">The past few decades, meanwhile, have been characterized by a proliferation of large heavy-duty gas turbines that are highly flexible and efficient, and can combust multiple fuels, including high volumes of hydrogen. That development is rooted in a combustion breakthrough in the 1990s that enabled a “lean premixed combustion process.” Compared to the early days of “dry-low NO<sub><span class="04Bodysubscript">x</span></sub>” (DLN) technology, when turbine inlet temperatures (TIT) of 1,350C–1,400C (for the vintage F class) were common, the past two decades have ushered in “advanced class” gas turbines with TIT pushing the 1,700C mark.</p>
<p class="04Body">Advanced gas turbine technology has also led to new world records in CCGT efficiency and gas turbine power output. Specifically, GE Power announced in March 2018 that the Chubu Electric Nishi-Nagoya power plant Block-1, powered by a GE 7HA gas turbine and Toshiba Energy Systems &amp; Solutions Corp.’s steam turbine and generator technology, had been recognized by Guinness World Records as the world’s “most efficient combined-cycle power plant,” based on achieving 63.08% gross efficiency. In August 2022, Duke Energy’s Lincoln Combustion Turbine Station, powered by a Siemens Energy SGT6-9000HL gas turbine, was certified with the official Guinness World Records title for the “most powerful simple-cycle gas power plant” with an output of 410.9 MW.</p>
<h2>Atomic Discoveries</h2>
<p>Although the concept of the atom was fairly well developed, scientists had not yet figured out how to harness the energy contained in atoms when the first issue of <i>POWER</i> magazine was published. But 13 years later, in 1895, the accidental discovery of X-rays by Wilhelm Röntgen started a wave of experimentation in the atomic field.</p>
<p>In the years that followed, radiation was discovered by Antoine Henri Becquerel, a French physicist; the Curies—Marie and Pierre—conducted additional radiation research and coined the term “radioactivity”; and Ernest Rutherford, a New Zealand-born British physicist, who many people consider the father of nuclear science, postulated the structure of the atom, proposed the laws of radioactive decay, and conducted groundbreaking research into the transmutation of elements.</p>
<p>Many other scientists were helping advance the world’s understanding of atomic principles. Albert Einstein developed his theory of special relativity, E = mc<sup>2</sup>, where E is energy, m is mass, and c is the speed of light, in 1905. Niels Bohr published his model of the atom in 1913, which was later perfected by James Chadwick when he discovered the neutron.</p>
<p>Enrico Fermi, an Italian physicist, in 1934 showed that neutrons could split atoms. Two German scientists—Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassman—expanded on that knowledge in 1938 when they discovered fission, and using Einstein’s theory, the team showed that the lost mass turned to energy.</p>
<h2>Early Nuclear Reactors</h2>
<p>Scientists then turned their attention to developing a self-sustaining chain reaction. To do so, a “critical mass” of uranium needed to be placed under the right conditions. Fermi, who emigrated to the U.S. in 1938 to escape fascist Italy’s racial laws, led a group of scientists at the University of Chicago in constructing the world’s first nuclear reactor.</p>
<p>The team’s design consisted of uranium placed in a stack of graphite to make a cube-like frame of fissionable material. The pile, known as Chicago Pile-1, was erected on the floor of a squash court beneath the University of Chicago’s athletic stadium (Figure 5). On December 2, 1942, the first self-sustaining nuclear reaction was demonstrated in Chicago Pile-1.</p>

<p>But the U.S. was a year into World War II at the time, and most of the atomic research being done then was focused on developing weapons technology. It was not until after the war that the U.S. government began encouraging the development of nuclear energy for peaceful civilian purposes. The first reactor to produce electricity from nuclear energy was Experimental Breeder Reactor I, on December 20, 1951, in Idaho.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union had a burgeoning nuclear power program at the time too. Its scientists modified an existing graphite-moderated channel-type plutonium production reactor for heat and electricity generation. In June 1954, that unit, located in Obninsk, began generating electricity. A few years later, on December 18, 1957, the first commercial U.S. nuclear power plant—Shippingport Atomic Power Station, a light-water reactor with a 60-MW capacity—was synchronized to the power grid in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The U.S. and Soviet Union weren’t the only countries building nuclear plants, however. The UK, Germany, Japan, France, and several others were jumping on the bandwagon too. The industry grew rapidly during the 1960s and 1970s. Nuclear construction projects were on drawing boards across the U.S., with 41 new units ordered in 1973 alone. But slower electricity demand growth, construction delays, cost overruns, and complicated regulatory requirements, put an end to the heyday in the mid-1970s. Nearly half of all planned U.S. projects ended up being canceled. Nonetheless, by 1991 the U.S. had twice as many operating commercial reactors—112 units—as any other country in the world.</p>
<p>Nuclear power’s history is tainted by three major accidents. The first was the partial meltdown of Three Mile Island Unit 2 on March 28, 1979. A combination of equipment malfunctions, design-related problems, and worker errors led to the meltdown. The second major accident occurred on April 26, 1986. That event was triggered by a sudden surge of power during a reactor systems test on Unit 4 at the Chernobyl nuclear power station in Ukraine, in the former Soviet Union. The accident and a subsequent fire released massive amounts of radioactive material into the environment.</p>
<p>The most-recent major accident occurred following a 9.0-magnitude earthquake off the coast of Japan on March 11, 2011. The quake caused the Fukushima Daiichi station to lose all off-site power. Backup systems worked, but 40 minutes after the quake, a 14-meter-high tsunami struck the area, knocking some of them out. Three reactors eventually overheated—melting their cores to some degree—then hydrogen explosions spread radioactive contamination throughout the area.</p>
<p class="04Body">The consequences of accidents have played a role in decisions to phase out or cut back reliance on nuclear power in some countries including Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, and Spain. Nonetheless, China, Russia, India, the United Arab Emirates, the U.S., and others continue to build new units, incorporating a lot of modern power plant technology (see sidebar “The Rise of IIoT”).</p>

<td class="photocaption">
<h2><b>The Rise of IIoT</b></h2>
<p>Power plant automation was already well-advanced by 2009, when more facilities shed boiler-turbine generator boards and vertical panels populated with indicators and strip chart recorders, and adopted open systems using industry-standard hardware and software. By then, companies were already beginning to grasp the value of digital modeling and virtual simulation, as well as sensors and wireless technologies.</p>
<p>The definitive shift arrived around 2012 with the introduction of the concept of the “industrial internet of things” (IIoT)—a term GE claims it coined—which described the connection between machines, advanced analytics, and the people who use them. According to GE, IIoT is “the network of a multitude of industrial devices connected by communications technologies that results in systems that can monitor, collect, exchange, analyze, and deliver valuable new insights like never before. These insights can then help drive smarter, faster business decisions for industrial companies.”</p>
<p>In the power sector, IIoT morphed into a multi-billion-dollar industry, and it has since enabled predictive analytics to forecast and detect component issues; it provides real-time production data (Big Data), which has opened up a realm of possibilities; and enabled software solutions—all of which have boosted efficiency, productivity, and performance. Over the last decade, several companies have rolled out comprehensive power plant–oriented IIoT platforms, such as GE’s Predix and Siemens’ MindSphere, and driven the rapid development of technologies that benefit from them, such as fourth-generation sensors, Big Data, edge intelligence, as well as augmented and virtual reality, and artificial intelligence and machine learning.</p>
<p>Separately, these and other digital possibilities have opened up a vast intelligence realm for other aspects of the power sector, including for grid—such as for forecasting, grid stability, outage response, distributed energy resource orchestration, communications, and mobility. Components manufacturing, too, is digitally evolving, with advancements in 3D printing, development of new materials, and process intensification.</td>

<h2>Renewables: The World’s Oldest and Newest Energy Sources</h2>
<p>While humans have been harnessing energy from the sun, wind, and water for thousands of years, technology has changed significantly over the course of history, and these ancient energy types have developed into state-of-the-art innovative power generation sources.</p>
<p><b>Chasing Water.</b> What became modern renewable energy generation got its start in the late 1800s, around the time that <i>POWER </i>launched. Hydropower was first to transition to a commercial electricity generation source, and it advanced very quickly. In 1880, Michigan’s Grand Rapids Electric Light and Power Co. generated DC electricity using hydropower at the Wolverine Chair Co. A belt-driven dynamo powered by a water turbine at the factory lit 16 arc street lamps.</p>
<p>Just two years later, the world’s first central DC hydroelectric station powered a paper mill in Appleton, Wisconsin. By 1886, there were 40 to 50 hydroelectric plants operating in the U.S. and Canada alone, and by 1888, roughly 200 electric companies relied on hydropower for at least some of their electricity generation (see sidebar “The Evolution of Power Business Models”). In 1889, the nation’s first AC hydroelectric plant came online, the Willamette Falls Station in Oregon City, Oregon.</p>
<table style="background-color: #d3d2c4;" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<tr>
<td class="photocaption">
<h2><b>The Evolution of Power Business Models</b></h2>
<p>The birth of the modern electric utility began when Thomas Edison invented the practical lightbulb in 1878, and, to spur demand for the novel invention, developed an entire power system that generated and distributed electricity. While the concept caught on in several cities in the early years, owing to exorbitant costs, power companies rarely owned several power plants.</p>
<p>Samuel Insull, who began his role as president at Chicago Edison in 1892, is credited with first exploiting load factor, not only finding power customers for off-peak times, but leveraging technology including larger generation systems and alternating current to produce and transmit power more cheaply. Crucially, he is also said to have pioneered consolidation; he acquired 20 small utilities by 1907 to give birth to a natural monopoly—Commonwealth Edison.</p>
<p>The model was widely emulated, and for decades, scale economies associated with large centralized generation technologies encouraged vertical integration to drive down power costs, encourage universal access, and provide reliability. To enforce the responsibilities and rights of these investor-owned utilities (IOUs) and their customers, however, this approach also spurred more government oversight and regulation. It also gave rise to both municipal ownership, and later, as a New Deal measure, public power to enable rural electrification.</p>
<p>Business models began to shift more distinctively starting in the late 1970s, as environmental policy, the oil shocks, and initiatives to open the airline and trucking industries to competition disrupted the status quo. The evolution that happened in the last 40 years, which has left an enduring legacy, is often categorized into two big buckets: the introduction of competition, and reforming the way monopoly utilities operate. A key step to initiating reforms in the U.S. stemmed from passage of the Public Utilities Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) of 1978, which essentially created opportunities for smaller generators to get into the game.</p>
<p>The final, but just as significant, historical upheaval was energy deregulation. In the 1990s, holding competition as the most effective driver of low power costs, several states also moved to end monopoly protections for retail sales—though after California’s high-profile energy crisis in 2000 and 2001, many scaled back their plans and even re-regulated their retail sectors. Deregulation had the important role of giving rise to new retail companies, whose business models were exclusively focused on delivery of power to the customer.</p>
<p>If and how these models thrive, however, is questionable. Decarbonization, decentralization, and digitalization—as well as the recent impact from the COVID-19 pandemic—have slackened or prompted a decline in power demand. At the same time, traditional regulatory approaches, which have been predicated on growth, must grapple with an increasingly complex industry landscape. The past decades have ushered in two-way flows of electricity, more stringent environmental policies, and state goals. Regulators are challenged with ensuring power systems are operating efficiently, complying with environmental goals, remain reliable, and address equity issues for low-income customers.</td>

<p>Internationally, Switzerland was at the forefront of pumped storage, opening the world’s first such plant in 1909. Pumped storage wasn’t integrated into the U.S. energy mix until 1930 when Connecticut Electric Light and Power Co. erected a pumped storage plant in New Milford, Connecticut.</p>
<p><b>Blowing in the Wind.</b> At about the same time that hydropower was gaining popularity, inventors were also figuring out how to use the windmills of the past to generate electricity for the future. In 1888, Charles Brush, an inventor in Ohio, constructed a 60-foot wind turbine in his backyard (Figure 6). The windmill’s wheel was 56 feet in diameter and had 144 blades. A shaft inside the tower turned pulleys and belts, which spun a 12-kW dynamo that was connected to batteries in Brush’s basement.</p>

<p>Wind-powered turbines slowly and with little fanfare spread throughout the world. The American Midwest, where the turbines were used to power irrigation pumps, saw numerous installations. In 1941, the world saw the first 1.25-MW turbine connected to the grid on a hill in Castleton, Vermont, called Grandpa’s Knob.</p>
<p>Interest in wind power was renewed by the oil crisis of the 1970s, which spurred research and development. Wind power in the U.S. got a policy boost when President Jimmy Carter signed the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, which required companies to buy a certain amount of electricity from renewable energy sources, including wind.</p>
<p class="04Body">By the 1980s, the first utility-scale wind farms began popping up in California. Europe has been the leader in offshore wind, with the first offshore wind farm installed in 1991 in Denmark. According to Wind Europe, Europe had 236 GW of installed wind capacity at the end of 2021, a significant increase from the 12.6 GW of capacity that was grid-connected five years earlier.</p>
<p class="04Body">In late 2016, the first offshore wind farm in the U.S., a five-turbine, 30-MW project, began operation in the waters off of Block Island, Rhode Island. Yet, by 2022, only one additional offshore wind project had been added to the U.S. grid—the two-turbine Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind pilot project with a generating capacity of 12 MW. However, onshore wind installations have fared much better. By mid-2022, more than 139 GW of onshore wind capacity was grid-connected in the U.S., according to American Clean Power, a renewable energy advocacy group.</p>
<p><b>Let the Sunshine In.</b> Compared to other commercially available renewable energy sources, solar power is in its infancy, though the path that led to its commercial use began almost 200 years ago. In 1839, French scientist Edmond Becquerel discovered the photovoltaic (PV) effect by experimenting with an electrolytic cell made of two metal electrodes in a conducting solution. Becquerel found that electricity generation increased when it was exposed to light.</p>
<p>More than three decades later, an English electrical engineer named Willoughby Smith discovered the photoconductivity of selenium. By 1882 the first solar cell was created by New York inventor Charles Fritts, who coated selenium with a layer of gold to develop a cell with an energy conversion rate of just 1–2%.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until the 1950s, however, that silicon solar cells were produced commercially. Physicists at Bell Laboratories determined silicon to be more efficient than selenium. The cell created by Bell Labs was “the first solar cell capable of converting enough of the sun’s energy into power to run everyday electrical equipment,” according to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).</p>
<p>By the 1970s, the efficiency of solar cells had increased, and they began to be used to power navigation warning lights and horns on many offshore gas and oil rigs, lighthouses, and railroad crossing signals. Domestic solar applications began to be viewed as sensible alternatives in remote locations where grid-connected options were not affordable.</p>
<p>The 1980s saw significant progress in the development of more-efficient, more-powerful solar projects. In 1982, the first PV megawatt-scale power station, developed by ARCO Solar, came online in Hesperia, California. Also in 1982, the DOE began operating Solar One, a 10-MW central-receiver demonstration project, the first project to prove the feasibility of power tower technology. Then, in 1992, researchers at the University of South Florida developed a 15.9%-efficient thin-film PV cell, the first to break the 15% efficiency barrier. By the mid-2000s, residential solar power systems were available for sale in home improvement stores.</p>
<p>In 2016, solar power from utility-scale facilities accounted for less than 0.9% of U.S. electricity generation. However, the solar industry has gained significant momentum since then. According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, there was more than 126 GW of solar power capacity installed in the U.S. at the end of March 2022, and the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that almost 4% of U.S. electricity came from solar energy in 2021.

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The carbon capture plant, built by UK-based carbon capture solutions provider Carbon Clean and Green Power International, an engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) firm, is designed to capture 20 tonnes per day (TPD) of CO</span><span class="s3"><sub>2</sub></span><span class="s1"> from a 500-MW unit’s flue gas using a modified tertiary amine. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s4">The pilot project, built for NTPC Energy Technology Research Alliance (NETRA),</span><span class="s5"> is part of an initiative NTPC unveiled in 2020 to build a CO<sub>2</sub>-to-methanol plant at a coal-fired power plant. NTPC <a href="https://www.ntpc.co.in/en/technology" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s1">envisions that the project</span></a> will comprise three parts: a carbon capture unit; a hydrogen generation unit that will use high-temperature steam electrolysis (HTSE) to generate<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>2 TPD of hydrogen; and a methanol production unit that will convert the CO<sub>2</sub> to methanol through a catalytic hydrogenation process.</span></p>
<h2>A Carbon Dioxide to Methanol Pilot</h2>
<p class="p7"><span class="s6">NTPC’s Vindhyachal Super Thermal Power Station in Vindhyanagar in Singrauli district of Madhya Pradesh, is a massive 13-unit facility that comprises six 210-MW units, first built in 1987, and four 500-MW units. A pithead power plant, it sources coal from the nearby </span><span class="s7">Nigahi Mines. The plant supplies power t</span><span class="s1">o the states of Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Daman, and Diu, as well as Dadra and Nagar Haveli. According to the Central Electricity Authority of India (CEA), the plant had a load factor of 85% in 2019, against the national average of 60.85% for coal-fired power plants in the nation.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Carbon Clean said the</span><span class="s8"> carbon capture pilot harvests flue gas from the 500-MW Unit 13, the plant’s newest unit, which came online in August 2015. </span><span class="s1">Carbon Clean’s CDRMax carbon capture technology can be used “with point source gases that contain CO</span><span class="s3"><sub>2</sub></span><span class="s1"> concentrations between 3% and 25% by volume and produces CO</span><span class="s3"><sub>2</sub></span><span class="s1"> with purities greater than 99%, which can then be sold, reused, or sequestered,” the company explained. The CDRMax process uses the company’s proprietary solvent, process equipment design, and advanced heat integration to significantly reduce both capital and operating costs, it said. </span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1">“Setting up of this 20 TPD demonstration plant is the first step towards decarbonizing the power plant,” Carbon Clean told <em>POWER</em> on Sept. 29. “The objectives of the project are to review the economics, design optimization, and waste heat utilization, in order to further reduce the overall cost of [carbon capture utilization],” it said. “Evidence suggests that it will be both feasible and cost-effective by using our carbon capture technology—CDRMax.”</span></p>
<h2>A Sustainability Pathway for NTPC</h2>
<p class="p13"><span class="s1">For New Dehli–based NTPC, India’s largest energy conglomerate, the carbon capture demonstration serves as an integral pathway to explore sustainable, stable, and low-carbon thermal power development. The company, which is 51.1% owned by the Indian government, holds a 70-GW fleet, including 25 coal-fired power plants with <a href="https://www.ntpc.co.in/en/power-generation/installed-capacity" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s9">a combined capacity of 50.5 GW</span></a>. </span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">The company is exploring several pathways to enable more efficient and cost-effective coal power. Vindhyachal, the largest plant in NTPC&#8217;s massive fleet, has recently served as the </span><span class="s8">site of a flexible operation study, which was spearheaded by the CEA and the Japan Coal Frontier Organization. </span><span class="s1">Vindhyachal </span><span class="s8">Unit 13, notably, in 2018 also pioneered <a href="https://www.ge.com/news/press-releases/ge-successfully-completes-ntpcs-first-wfgd-system-vindhyachal-power-plant" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s1">India’s first wet</span></a> </span><span class="s1"><a href="https://www.ge.com/news/press-releases/ge-successfully-completes-ntpcs-first-wfgd-system-vindhyachal-power-plant">flue gas desulfurization unit</a> suitable for 100% gas flow continuous operation. </span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="s1">NTPC is committed to sustainability, however, and it is currently also working to deploy 60 GW of renewable capacity by 2032. As part of its “Brighter Plan 2032” goals, it has also set out to explore commercial-scale carbon capture, hydrogen generation, and conversion to methanol. </span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s6">Methanol, in particular, is seen as a feasible pathway for carbon capture utilization because the chemical </span><span class="s1">(CH<sub>3</sub>OH) is an important industrial raw material. Methanol is currently widely used as a starting substrate for the synthesis of various other chemical compounds like acids, anhydrides, and esters, used in adhesives, foams, paints, and polymers. However, <a href="https://www.methanol.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Methanol-Institute-Interview-India-Energetica-Magazine-Feb-2022-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s10">experts say</span></a> it can also be used as a low-carbon alternative fuel for many sectors, mainly because it has the highest hydrogen-to-carbon ratio of any liquid fuel.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="s1">Methanol production from captured carbon could “ensure that we generate a clean fuel as well as sequester carbon from the environment,” as well as add “great economic value,” NTPC said in its most <a href="https://esg.churchgatepartners.com/login/companyprofile?id=330030003300240024004100530048004F004B0041004E0041004E00590041004100560041004E004900410053004800570049004E00490024002400" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s9">recent sustainability filing</span></a>. </span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="s1">In July 2022, the company signed a memorandum of understanding with Gujarat Alkalies and Chemicals Ltd. to mutually explore opportunities to supply 100 MW “round the clock” power and synthesize 75 TPD of green methanol and 35<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>TPD of green ammonia for captive use at GACL. If the project comes to fruition, it would be </span><span class="s11">“the first commercial-scale green ammonia and green methanol project in the country,” NTPC said. </span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s8">The carbon capture project at </span><span class="s1">Vindhyachal is being watched carefully, given the Indian government’s ambitions to leverage carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS) for its energy security and emission abatement aspirations. The country, which is currently </span><span class="s12">heavily reliant on coal power,</span><span class="s13"> is acting with urgency. <a href="https://www.powermag.com/india-sets-net-zero-goal-for-2070-calls-for-1t-in-firm-climate-finance-commitments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s1">Last year it set out to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2070</span></a>. </span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="s1">In a <a href="https://www.oil-india.com/PDF/Draft_UFCC_Roadmap_2030_v2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s14">June 2022–issued draft roadmap</span></a>, India’s Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas proposed several measures to achieve quick deployment of CCUS/CCS technologies, including financial support for early movers and funding programs for up to 10 demonstration projects. </span></p>
